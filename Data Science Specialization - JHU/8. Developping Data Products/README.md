##Developing data product project

I adapted the [Shiny word cloud App](http://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/word-cloud.html) for my own books. It creates word cloud based on the words found in the book chosen.

Here is my [Shiny app "Book Word Cloud"](https://stephaniecnvs.shinyapps.io/Book-Word-Cloud/)

Here is the [Presentation slides deck](http://rpubs.com/Stephaniecnvs/book-word-cloud)

**How to use the application:**

1. Choose your favorite book
2. Change book and a word cloud appears
3. Use slider *Minimum Frequency of Words* and *Maximum Number of Words* to change the appearance of the word cloud

***Note:*** There is a bug with the slider "Minimum Frequency of Words" which I need to fix
