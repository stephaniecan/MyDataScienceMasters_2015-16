Foreword
BY RUSSELL E. DICARLO
Author of Towards a New World
View Blanketed by an azure sky, the orange-yellow rays of the setting sun can, at
special times, gift us with a moment of such considerable beauty, we find ourselves
momentarily stunned, with frozen gaze. The splendor of the moment so dazzles us,
our compulsively chattering minds give pause, so as not to mentally whisk us away to
a place other than the here-and-now. Bathed in luminescence, a door seems to open to
another reality, always present, yet rarely witnessed.
Abraham Maslow called these "peak experiences," since they represent the high
moments of life where we joyfully find ourselves catapulted beyond the confines of
the mundane and ordinary. He might just as well have called them "peek'
experiences. During these expansive occasions, we sneak a glimpse of the eternal
realm of Being itself. If only for a brief moment in time, we come home to our True
Self.
'Ah," one might sigh, "so grand ... if only I could stay here. But how do I take up
permanent residence?"
During the past ten years, I have committed myself to finding out. During my search,
I have been honored to engage in dialogue with some of the most daring, inspiring
and insightful "paradigm pioneers" of our time: in medicine, science, psychology,
business, religion / spirituality, and human potential. This diverse group of
individuals is joined by their commonly voiced insight that humanity is now taking a
quantum leap forward in its evolutionary development. This change is accompanied
by a shift in world view ­ the basic picture we carry with us of "the way things are."
A world view seeks to answer two fundamental questions, "Who are we?" and "What
is the nature of the Universe in which we live?" Our answers to these questions
dictate the quality and characteristics of our personal relationships with family,
friends and employers /employees. When considered on a larger scale, they define
societies.
It should be of little surprise that the world view which is emerging calls into
question many of the things Western society holds to be true:

MYTH #1 Humanity has reached the pinnacle of its development.
Esalen co-founder Michael Murphy, drawing upon comparative religious studies,
medical science, anthropology, and sports, has made a provocative case that there are

                                            4

more advanced stages of human development. As a person reaches these advanced
levels of spiritual maturity, extraordinary capacities begin to blossom - of love,
vitality, personhood, bodily awareness, intuition, perception, communication, and
volition.
First step: to recognize they exist. Most people do not. Then, methods can be
employed with conscious intention.

MYTH #2 We are completely separate from each other, nature, and the Kosmos.
This myth of "other-than-me" has been responsible for wars, the rape of the planet,
and all forms and expressions of human injustice. After all, who in their right mind
would harm another if they experienced that person as part of themselves? Stan Grof,
in his research of nonordinary states of consciousness, summarizes by saying "the
psyche and consciousness of each of us is, in the last analysis, commensurate with
"All-That-Is" because there are no absolute boundaries between the body/ego and the
totality of existence."
Dr. Larry Dossey's Era-3 medicine, where the thoughts, attitudes, and healing
intentions of one individual can influence the physiology of another person (in
contrast to Era-2, prevailing mind-body medicine) is very well supported by scientific
studies into the healing power of prayer. Now this can't happen according to the
known principles of physics and world view of traditional science. Yet the
preponderance of evidence suggests that indeed it does.

MYTH #3 The physical world is all there is.
Materialistically bound, traditional science assumes that anything that cannot be
measured, tested in a laboratory, or probed by the five senses or their technological
extensions simply doesn't exist. it's "not real." The consequence: all of reality has
been collapsed into physical reality. Spiritual, or what I would call nonphysical,
dimensions of reality have been run out of town.
This clashes with the "perennial philosophy," that philosophical consensus spanning
ages, religions, traditions, and cultures, which describes different but continuous
dimensions of reality. These run from the most dense and least conscious - what we'd
call "matter" - to the least dense and most conscious, which we'd call spiritual.
Interestingly enough, this extended, multidimensional model of reality is suggested
by quantum theorists such as Jack Scarfetti who describes superluminal travel. Other
dimensions of reality are used to explain travel that occurs faster than the speed of
light - the ultimate of speed limits. Or consider the work of the legendary physicist,




                                           5

David    Bohm,    with   his   explicate   (physical)  and   implicate   (non-physical)
multidimensional model of reality.
This is no mere theory - the 1982 Aspect Experiment in France demonstrated, that
two once-connected quantum particles separated by vast distances remained
somehow connected. If one particle was changed, the other changed - instantly.
Scientists don't know the mechanics of how this faster-than-the-speed-of-light travel
can happen, though some theorists suggest that this connection takes place via
doorways into higher dimensions.
So contrary to what those who pledge their allegiance to the traditional paradigm
might think, the influential, pioneering individuals I spoke with felt that we have not
reached the pinnacle of human development, we are connected, rather than separate,
from all of life, and that the full spectrum of consciousness encompasses both phys-
ical and a multitude of non physical dimensions of reality.
At core, this new world view involves seeing yourself, others, and all of life, not
through the eyes of our small, earthly self that lives in time and is born in time. But
rather through the eyes of the soul, our Being, the True Self. One by one, people are
jumping to this higher orbit.
With his book, The Power of Now, Eckhart Tolle rightfully takes his place among this
special group of world-class teachers. Eckhart's message: the problem of humanity is
deeply rooted in the mind itself. Or rather, our misidentification with mind.
Our drifting awareness, our tendency to take the path of least resistance by being less
than fully awake to the present moment, creates a void. And the time-bound mind,
which has been designed to be a useful servant, compensates by proclaiming itself
master. Like a butterfly flittering from one flower to another, the mind engages past
experiences or, projecting its own made-for-television movie, anticipates what is to
come. Seldom do we find ourselves resting in the oceanic depth of the here and now.
For it is here - in the Now - where we find our True Self, which lies behind our
physical body, shifting emotions, and chattering mind.
The crowning glory of human development rests not in our ability to reason and
think, though this is what distinguishes us from animals. Intellect, like instinct, is
merely a point along the way. Our ultimate destiny is to re-connect with our essential
Being and express from our extraordinary, divine reality in the ordinary physical
world, moment by moment. Easy to say, yet rare are those who have attained the
further reaches of human development.
Fortunately, there are guides and teachers to help us along the way. As a teacher and
guide, Eckhart's formidable power lies not in his adept ability to delight us with


                                            6

entertaining stories, make the abstract concrete, or provide useful technique. Rather,
his magic is seated in his personal experience, as one who knows. As a result, there is
a power behind his words found only in the most celebrated of spiritual teachers. By
living from the depths of this Greater Reality, Eckhart clears an energetic pathway for
others to join him.
And what if others do? Surely the world as we know it would change for the better.
Values would shift in the flotsam of vanishing fears that have been funneled away
through the whirlpool of Being itself. A new civilization would be born.
"Where's the proof of this Greater Reality?" you ask. I offer only an analogy: A
battery of scientists can get together and tell you about all the scientific proof for the
fact that bananas are bitter. But all you have to do is taste one, once, to realize that
there is this whole other aspect to bananas. Ultimately, proof lies not in intellectual
arguments, but in being touched in some way by the sacred within and without.
Eckhart Tolle masterfully opens us to that possibility.

INTRODUCTION



The Origin Of This Book
I have little use for the past and rarely think about it; however, I would briefly like to
tell you how I came to be a spiritual teacher and how this book came into existence.
Until my thirtieth year, I lived in a state of almost continuous anxiety interspersed
with periods of suicidal depression. It feels now as if I am talking about some past
lifetime or somebody else's life.
One night not long after my twenty-ninth birthday, I woke up in the early hours with
a feeling of absolute dread. I had woken up with such a feeling many times before,
but this time it was more intense than it had ever been. The silence of the night, the
vague outlines of the furniture in the dark room, the distant noise of a passing train -
everything felt so alien, so hostile, and so utterly meaningless that it created in me a
deep loathing of the world. The most loathsome thing of all, however, was my own
existence. What was the point in continuing to live with this burden of misery? Why
carry on with this continuous struggle? I could feel that a deep longing for
annihilation, for nonexistence, was now becoming much stronger than the instinctive
desire to continue to live.
"I cannot live with myself any longer." This was the thought that kept repeating itself
in my mind. Then suddenly I became aware of what a peculiar thought it was. `Am I
one or two? If I cannot live with myself, there must be two of me: the `I' and the `self'
that `I' cannot live with." "Maybe," I thought, "only one of them is real."
I was so stunned by this strange realization that my mind stopped. I was fully
conscious, but there were no more thoughts. Then I felt drawn into what seemed like
a vortex of energy. It was a slow movement at first and then accelerated. I was
gripped by an intense fear, and my body started to shake. I heard the words "resist
nothing," as if spoken inside my chest. I could feel myself being sucked into a void. It
felt as if the void was inside myself rather than outside. Suddenly, there was no more
fear, and I let myself fall into that void. I have no recollection of what happened after
that.
I was awakened by the chirping of a bird outside the window. I had never heard such
a sound before. My eyes were still closed, and I saw the image of a precious
diamond. Yes, if a diamond could make a sound, this is what it would be like. I

                                              8

opened my eyes. The first light of dawn was filtering through the curtains. Without
any thought, I felt, I knew, that there is infinitely more to light than we realize. That
soft luminosity filtering through the curtains was love itself. Tears came into my
eyes. I got up and walked around the room. I recognized the room, and yet I knew
that I had never truly seen it before. Everything was fresh and pristine, as if it had just
come into existence. I picked up things, a pencil, an empty bottle, marveling at the
beauty and aliveness of it all.
That day I walked around the city in utter amazement at the miracle of life on earth,
as if I had just been born into this world.
For the next five months, I lived in a state of uninterrupted deep peace and bliss.
After that, it diminished somewhat in intensity, or perhaps it just seemed to because it
became my natural state. I could still function in the world, although I realized that
nothing I ever did could possibly add anything to what I already had.
I knew, of course, that something profoundly significant had happened to me, but I
didn't understand it at all. It wasn't until several years later, after I had read spiritual
texts and spent time with spiritual teachers, that I realized that what everybody was
looking for had already happened to me. I understood that the intense pressure of
suffering that night must have forced my consciousness to withdraw from its
identification with the unhappy and deeply fearful self, which is ultimately a fiction
of the mind. This withdrawal must have been so complete that this false, suffering
self immediately collapsed, just as if a plug had been pulled out of an inflatable toy.
What was left then was my true nature as the ever-present I am: consciousness in its
pure state prior to identification with form. Later I also learned to go into that inner
timeless and deathless realm that I had originally perceived as a void and remain fully
conscious. I dwelt in states of such indescribable bliss and sacredness that even the
original experience I just described pales in comparison. A time came when, for a
while, I was left with nothing on the physical plane. I had no relationships, no job, no
home, no socially defined identity. I spent almost two years sitting on park benches in
a state of the most intense joy.
But even the most beautiful experiences come and go. More fundamental, perhaps,
than any experience is the undercurrent of peace that has never left me since then.
Sometimes it is very strong, almost palpable, and others can feel it too. At other
times, it is somewhere in the background, like a distant melody.
Later, people would occasionally come up to me and say: "I want what you have. Can
you give it to me, or show me how to get it?" And I would say: "You have it already.
You just can't feel it because your mind is malting too much noise." That answer later
grew into the book that you are holding in your hands.

                                              9

Before I knew it, I had an external identity again. I had become a spiritual teacher.


The Truth That Is Within You
This book represents the essence of my work, as far as it can be conveyed in words,
with individuals and small groups of spiritual seekers during the past ten years, in
Europe and in North America. In deep love and appreciation, I would like to thank
those exceptional people for their courage, their willingness to embrace inner
change,their challenging questions, and their readiness to listen. This book would not
have come into existence without them. They belong to what is as yet a small but
fortunately growing minority of spiritual pioneers: people who are reaching a point
where they become capable of breaking out of inherited collective mind-patterns that
have kept humans in bondage to suffering for eons.
I trust that this book will find its way to those who are ready for such radical inner
transformation and so act as a catalyst for it. I also hope that it will reach many others
who will find its content worthy of consideration, although they may not be ready to
fully live or practice it. It is possible that at a later time, the seed that was sown when
reading this book will merge with the seed of enlightenment that each human being
carries within, and suddenly that seed will sprout and come alive within them.
The book in its present form originated, often spontaneously, in response to questions
asked by individuals in seminars, meditation classes and private counseling sessions,
and so I have kept the question and answer format. I learned and received as much in
those classes and sessions as the questioners. Some of the questions and answers I
wrote down almost verbatim. Others are generic, which is to say I combined certain
types of' questions that were frequently asked into one, and extracted the essence
from different answers to form one generic answer. Sometimes, in the process of
writing, an entirely new answer came that was more profound or insightful than
anything I had ever uttered. Some additional questions were asked by the editor so as
to provide further clarification of certain points.
You will find that from the first to the last page, the dialogues continuously alternate
between two different levels.
On one level, I draw your attention to what is false in you. I speak of the nature of
human unconsciousness and dysfunction as well as its most common behavioral
manifestations, from conflict in relationships to warfare between tribes or nations.
Such knowledge is vital, for unless you learn to recognize the false as false --as not
you-- there can be no lasting transformation, and you would always end up being
drawn back into illusion and into some form of pain. On this level, I also show you



                                               10

how not to make that which is false in you into a self and into a personal problem, for
that is how the false perpetuates itself.
On another level, I speak of a profound transformation of human consciousness - not
as a distant future possibility, but available now - no matter who or where you are.
You are shown how to free yourself from enslavement to the mind, enter into this
enlightened state of consciousness and sustain it in everyday life.
On this level of the book, the words are not always concerned with information, but
often designed to draw you into this new consciousness as you read. Again and again,
I endeavor to take you with me into that timeless state of intense conscious presence
in the Now, so as to give you a taste of enlightenment. Until you are able to expe-
rience what I speak of, you may find those passages somewhat repetitive. As soon as
you do, however, I believe you will realize that they contain a great deal of spiritual
power, and they may become for you the most rewarding parts of the book.
Moreover, since every person carries the seed of enlightenment within, I often
address myself to the knower in you who dwells behind the thinker, the deeper self
that immediately recognizes spiritual truth, resonates with it, and gains strength from
it.
The pause symbol ~ after certain passages is a suggestion that you may want to stop
reading for a moment, become still, and feel and experience the truth of what has just
been said. There may be other places in the text where you will do this naturally and
spontaneously.
As you begin reading the book, the meaning of certain words, such as "Being" or
"presence," may not be entirely clear to you at first. Just read on. Questions or
objections may occasionally come into your mind as you read. They will probably be
answered later in the book, or they may turn out to be irrelevant as you go more
deeply into the teaching - and into yourself.
Don't read with the mind only. Watch out for any "feeling response" as you read and
a sense of recognition from deep within. I cannot tell you any spiritual truth that deep
within you don't know already. All I can do is remind you of what you have
forgotten. Living knowledge, ancient and yet ever new, is then activated and released
from within every cell of your body.
The mind always wants to categorize and compare, but this book will work better for
you if you do not attempt to compare its terminology with that of other teachings;
otherwise, you will probably become confused. I use words such as "mind,"
"happiness," and "consciousness" in ways that do not necessarily correlate with other
teachings. Don't get attached to any words. They are only stepping stones, to be left
behind as quickly as possible.

                                           11

When I occasionally quote the words of Jesus or the Buddha, from A Course in
Miracles or from other teachings, I do so not in order to compare, but to draw your
attention to the fact that in essence there is and always has been only one spiritual
teaching, although it comes in many forms. Some of these forms, such as the ancient
religions, have become so overlaid with extraneous matter that their spiritual essence
has become almost completely obscured by it. To a large extent, therefore, their
deeper meaning is no longer recognized and their transformative power lost. When I
quote from the ancient religions or other teachings, it is to reveal their deeper
meaning and thereby restore their transformative power - particularly for those
readers who are followers of these religions or teachings. I say to them: there is no
need to go elsewhere for the truth. Let me show you how to go more deeply into what
you already have.
Mostly, however, I have endeavored to use terminology that is as neutral as possible
in order to reach a wide range of people. This book can be seen as a restatement for
our time of that one timeless spiritual teaching, the essence of all religions. It is not
derived from external sources, but from the one true Source within, so it contains no
theory or speculation. I speak from inner experience, and if at times I speak
forcefully, it is to cut through heavy layers of mental resistance and to reach that
place within you where you already know, just as I know, and where the truth is
recognized when it is heard. There is then a feeling of exaltation and heightened
aliveness, as something within you says: "Yes. I know this is true."

1. YOU ARE NOT YOUR MIND



The Greatest Obstacle to Enlightenment
Enlightenment - what is that?
A beggar had been sitting by the side of a road for over thirty years. One day a
stranger walked by. "Spare some change?" mumbled the beggar, mechanically
holding out his old baseball cap. "I have nothing to give you," said the stranger. Then
he asked: "What's that you are sitting on?" "Nothing," replied the beggar. "Just an old
box. I have been sitting on it for as long as I can remember." "Ever looked inside?"
asked the stranger. "No," said the beggar. "What's the point? There's nothing in
there." "Have a look inside," insisted the stranger. The beggar managed to pry open
the lid. With astonishment, disbelief, and elation, he saw that the box was filled with
gold.
     I am that stranger who has nothing to give you and who is telling you to look
inside. Not inside any box, as in the parable, but somewhere even closer: inside
yourself.
     "But I am not a beggar," I can hear you say.
     Those who have not found their true wealth, which is the radiant joy of Being
and the deep, unshakable peace that comes with it, are beggars, even if they have
great material wealth. They are looking outside for scraps of pleasure or fulfillment,
for validation, security, or love, while they have a treasure within that not only
includes all those things but is infinitely greater than anything the world can offer.
     The word enlightenment conjures up the idea of some super-human
accomplishment, and the ego likes to keep it that way, but it is simply your natural
state of felt oneness with Being. It is a state of connectedness with something
immeasurable and indestructible, something that, almost paradoxically, is essentially
you and yet is much greater than you. It is finding your true nature beyond name and
form. The inability to feel this connectedness gives rise to the illusion of separation,
from yourself and from the world around you. You then perceive yourself,
consciously or unconsciously, as an isolated fragment. Fear arises, and conflict within
and without becomes the norm.
     I love the Buddha's simple definition of enlightenment as "the end of suffering."
There is nothing superhuman in that, is there? Of course, as a definition, it is

                                             13

incomplete. It only tells you what enlightenment is not: no suffering. But what's left
when there is no more suffering? The Buddha is silent on that, and his silence implies
that you'll have to find out for yourself. He uses a negative definition so that the mind
cannot make it into something to believe in or into a superhuman accomplishment, a
goal that is impossible for you to attain. Despite this precaution, the majority of
Buddhists still believe that enlightenment is for the Buddha, not for them, at least not
in this lifetime.


      You used the word Being. Can you explain what you mean by that?
      Being is the eternal, ever-present One Life beyond the myriad forms of life that
are subject to birth and death. However, Being is not only beyond but also deep
within every form as its innermost invisible and indestructible essence. This means
that it is accessible to you now as your own deepest self, your true nature. But don't
seek to grasp it with your mind. Don't try to understand it. You can know it only
when the mind is still. When you are present, when your attention is fully and
intensely in the Now, Being can be felt, but it can never be understood mentally. To
regain awareness of Being and to abide in that state of "feeling-realization" is
enlightenment.


      When you say Being, are you talking about God? If you are, then why don't you
say it?
      The word God has become empty of meaning through thousands of years of
misuse. I use it sometimes, but I do so sparingly. By misuse, I mean that people who
have never even glimpsed the realm of the sacred, the infinite vastness behind that
word, use it with great conviction, as if they knew what they are talking about. Or
they argue against it, as if they knew what it is that they are denying. This misuse
gives rise to absurd beliefs, assertions, and egoic delusions, such as "My or our God
is the only true God, and your God is false," or Nietzsche's famous statement "God is
dead."
      The word God has become a closed concept. The moment the word is uttered, a
mental image is created, no longer, perhaps, of an old man with a white beard, but
still a mental representation of someone or something outside you, and, yes, almost
inevitably a male someone or something.
      Neither God nor Being nor any other word can define or explain the ineffable
reality behind the word, so the only important question is whether the word is a help
or a hindrance in enabling you to experience That toward which it points. Does it


                                            14

point beyond itself to that transcendental reality, or does it lend itself too easily to
becoming no more than an idea in your head that you believe in, a mental idol?
     The word Being explains nothing, but nor does God. Being, however, has the
advantage that it is an open concept. It does not reduce the infinite invisible to a finite
entity. It is impossible to form a mental image of it. Nobody can claim exclusive
possession of Being. It is your very essence, and it is immediately accessible to you
as the feeling of your own presence, the realization I am that is prior to I am this or I
am that. So it is only a small step from the word Being to the experience of Being.


     What is the greatest obstacle to experiencing this reality?
     Identification with your mind, which causes thought to become compulsive. Not
to be able to stop thinking is a dreadful affliction, but we don't realize this because
almost everybody is suffering from it, so it is considered normal. This incessant
mental noise prevents you from finding that realm of inner stillness that is inseparable
from Being. It also creates a false mind-made self that casts a shadow of fear and
suffering. We will look at all that in more detail later.
     The philosopher Descartes believed that he had found the most fundamental
truth when he made his famous statement: "I think, therefore I am." He had, in fact,
given expression to the most basic error: to equate thinking with Being and identity
with thinking. The compulsive thinker, which means almost everyone, lives in a state
of apparent separateness, in an insanely complex world of continuous problems and
conflict, a world that reflects the ever-increasing fragmentation of the mind.
Enlightenment is a state of wholeness, of being "at one" and therefore at peace. At
one with life in its manifested aspect, the world, as well as with your deepest self and
life unmanifested - at one with Being. Enlightenment is not only the end of suffering
and of continuous conflict within and without, but also the end of the dreadful
enslavement to incessant thinking. What an incredible liberation this is!
     Identification with your mind creates an opaque screen of concepts, labels,
images, words, judgments, and definitions that blocks all true relationship. It comes
between you and yourself, between you and your fellow man and woman, between
you and nature, between you and God. It is this screen of thought that creates the
illusion of separateness, the illusion that there is you and a totally separate "other."
You then forget the essential fact that, underneath the level of physical appearances
and separate forms, you are one with all that is. By "forget," I mean that you can no
longer feel this oneness as self-evident reality. You may believe it to be true, but you
no longer know it to be true. A belief may be comforting. Only through your own
experience, however, does it become liberating.

                                            15

      Thinking has become a disease. Disease happens when things get out of balance.
For example, there is nothing wrong with cells dividing and multiplying in the body,
but when this process continues in disregard of the total organism, cells proliferate
and we have disease.
      Note: The mind is a superb instrument if used rightly. Used wrongly, however, it
becomes very destructive. To put it more accurately, it is not so much that you use
your mind wrongly - you usually don't use it at all. It uses you. This is the disease.
You believe that you are your mind. This is the delusion. The instrument has taken
you over.


      I don't quite agree. It is true that I do a lot of aimless thinking, like most people,
but I can still choose to use my mind to get and accomplish things, and I do that all
the time.
      Just because you can solve a crossword puzzle or build an atom bomb doesn't
mean that you use your mind. Just as dogs love to chew bones, the mind loves to get
its teeth into problems. That's why it does crossword puzzles and builds atom bombs.
You have no interest in either. Let me ask you this: can you be free of your mind
whenever you want to? Have you found the "off" button?


      You mean stop thinking altogether? No, I can't, except maybe for a moment or
two.
      Then the mind is using you. You are unconsciously identified with it, so you
don't even know that you are its slave. It's almost as if you were possessed without
knowing it, and so you take the possessing entity to be yourself. The beginning of
freedom is the realization that you are not the possessing entity - the thinker.
Knowing this enables you to observe the entity. The moment you start watching the
thinker, a higher level of consciousness becomes activated. You then begin to realize
that there is a vast realm of intelligence beyond thought, that thought is only a tiny
aspect of that intelligence. You also realize that all the things that truly matter -
beauty, love, creativity, joy, inner peace - arise from beyond the mind. You begin to
awaken.


Freeing yourself from your mind
What exactly do you mean by "watching the thinker"?
When someone goes to the doctor and says, "I hear a voice in my head," he or she
will most likely be sent to a psychiatrist. The fact is that, in a very similar way,


                                              16

virtually everyone hears a voice, or several voices, in their head all the time: the
involuntary thought processes that you don't realize you have the power to stop.
Continuous monologues or dialogues.
     You have probably come across "mad" people in the street incessantly talking or
muttering to themselves. Well, that's not much different from what you and all other
"normal" people do, except that you don't do it out loud. The voice comments,
speculates, judges, compares, complains, likes, dislikes, and so on. The voice isn't
necessarily relevant to the situation you find yourself in at the time; it may be
reviving the recent or distant past or rehearsing or imagining possible future
situations. Here it often imagines things going wrong and negative outcomes; this is
called worry. Sometimes this soundtrack is accompanied by visual images or "mental
movies." Even if the voice is relevant to the situation at hand, it will interpret it in
terms of the past. This is because the voice belongs to your conditioned mind, which
is the result of all your past history as well as of the collective cultural mind-set you
inherited. So you see and judge the present through the eyes of the past and get a
totally distorted view of it. It is not uncommon for the voice to be a person's own
worst enemy. Many people live with a tormentor in their head that continuously
attacks and punishes them and drains them of vital energy. It is the cause of untold
misery and unhappiness, as well as of disease.
     The good news is that you can free yourself from your mind. This is the only
true liberation. You can take the first step right now. Start listening to the voice in
your head as often as you can. Pay particular attention to any repetitive thought
patterns, those old gramophone records that have been playing in your head perhaps
for many years. This is what I mean by "watching the thinker," which is another way
of saying: listen to the voice in your head, be there as the witnessing presence.
     When you listen to that voice, listen to it impartially. That is to say, do not
judge. Do not judge or condemn what you hear, for doing so would mean that the
same voice has come in again through the back door. You'll soon realize: there is the
voice, and here I am listening to it, watching it. This I am realization, this sense of
your own presence, is not a thought. It arises from beyond the mind.


     So when you listen to a thought, you are aware not only of the thought but also
of yourself as the witness of the thought. A new dimension of consciousness has
come in. As you listen to the thought, you feel a conscious presence - your deeper
self - behind or underneath the thought, as it were. The thought then loses its power
over you and quickly subsides, because you are no longer energizing the mind
through identification with it. This is the beginning of the end of involuntary and

                                            17

compulsive thinking. When a thought subsides, you experience a discontinuity in the
mental stream - a gap of "no-mind." At first, the gaps will be short, a few seconds
perhaps, but gradually they will become longer. When these gaps occur, you feel a
certain stillness and peace inside you. This is the beginning of your natural state of
felt oneness with Being, which is usually obscured by the mind. With practice, the
sense of stillness and peace will deepen. In fact, there is no end to its depth. You will
also feel a subtle emanation of joy arising from deep within: the joy of Being.
     It is not a trancelike state. Not at all. There is no loss of consciousness here. The
opposite is the case. If the price of peace were a lowering of your consciousness, and
the price of stillness a lack of vitality and alertness, then they would not be worth
having. In this state of inner connectedness, you are much more alert, more awake
than in the mind-identified state. You are fully present. It also raises the vibrational
frequency of the energy field that gives life to the physical body.
     As you go more deeply into this realm of no-mind, as it is sometimes called in
the East, you realize the state of pure consciousness. In that state, you feel your own
presence with such intensity and such joy that all thinking, all emotions, your
physical body, as well as the whole external world become relatively insignificant in
comparison to it. And yet this is not a selfish but a selfless state. It takes you beyond
what you previously thought of as "your self." That presence is essentially you and at
the same time inconceivably greater than you. What I am trying to convey here may
sound paradoxical or even contradictory, but there is no other way that I can express
it.
      Instead of "watching the thinker," you can also create a gap in the mind stream
simply by directing the focus of your attention into the Now. Just become intensely
conscious of the present moment. This is a deeply satisfying thing to do. In this way,
you draw consciousness away from mind activity and create a gap of no-mind in
which you are highly alert and aware but not thinking. This is the essence of
meditation. In your everyday life, you can practice this by taking any routine activity
that normally is only a means to an end and giving it your fullest attention, so that it
becomes an end in itself. For example, every time you walk up and down the stairs in
your house or place of work, pay close attention to every step, every movement, even
your breathing. Be totally present. Or when you wash your hands, pay attention to all
the sense perceptions associated with the activity: the sound and feel of the water, the
movement of your hands, the scent of the soap, and so on. Or when you get into your
car, after you close the door, pause for a few seconds and observe the flow of your
breath. Become aware of a silent but powerful sense of presence. There is one certain



                                              18

criterion by which you can measure your success in this practice: the degree of peace
that you feel within.
      So the single most vital step on your journey toward enlightenment is this: learn
to disidentify from your mind. Every time you create a gap in the stream of mind, the
light of your consciousness grows stronger. One day you may catch yourself smiling
at the voice in your head, as you would smile at the antics of a child. This means that
you no longer take the content of your mind all that seriously, as your sense of self
does not depend on it.


Enlightenment: Rising above Thought
Isn't thinking essential in order to survive in this world?
Your mind is an instrument, a tool. It is there to be used for a specific task, and when
the task is completed, you lay it down. As it is, I would say about 80 to 90 percent of
most people's thinking is not only repetitive and useless, but because of its
dysfunctional and often negative nature, much of it is also harmful. Observe your
mind and you will find this to be true. It causes a serious leakage of vital energy.
This kind of compulsive thinking is actually an addiction. What characterizes an
addiction? Quite simply this: you no longer feel that you have the choice to stop. It
seems stronger than you. It also gives you a false sense of pleasure, pleasure that
invariably turns into pain.


Why should we be addicted to thinking?
Because you are identified with it, which means that you derive your sense of self
from the content and activity of your mind.
      Because you believe that you would cease to be if you stopped thinking. As you
grow up, you form a mental image of who you are, based on your personal and
cultural conditioning. We may call this phantom self the ego. It consists of mind
activity and can only be kept going through constant thinking. The term ego means
different things to different people, but when I use it here it means a false self, created
by unconscious identification with the mind.
       To the ego, the present moment hardly exists. Only past and future are
considered important. This total reversal of the truth accounts for the fact that in the
ego mode the mind is so dysfunctional. It is always concerned with keeping the past
alive, because without it - who are you? It constantly projects itself into the future to
ensure its continued survival and to seek some kind of release or fulfillment there. It
says: "One day, when this, that, or the other happens, I am going to be okay, happy, at


                                            19

peace." Even when the ego seems to be concerned with the present, it is not the
present that it sees: It misperceives it completely because it looks at it through the
eyes of the past. Or it reduces the present to a means to an end, an end that always
lies in the mind-projected future. Observe your mind and you'll see that this is how it
works.
      The present moment holds the key to liberation. But you cannot find the present
moment as long as you are your mind.


I don't want to lose my ability to analyze and discriminate. I wouldn't mind learning
to think more clearly, in a more focused way, but I don't want to lose my mind. The
gift of thought is the most precious thing we have. Without it, we would just be
another species of animal.
The predominance of mind is no more than a stage in the evolution of consciousness.
We need to go on to the next stage now as a matter of urgency; otherwise, we will be
destroyed by the mind, which has grown into a monster. I will talk about this in more
detail later. Thinking and consciousness are not synonymous. Thinking is only a
small aspect of consciousness. Thought cannot exist without consciousness, but
consciousness does not need thought.
      Enlightenment means rising above thought, not falling back to a level below
thought, the level of an animal or a plant. In the enlightened state, you still use your
thinking mind when needed, but in a much more focused and effective way than
before. You use it mostly for practical purposes, but you are free of the involuntary
internal dialogue, and there is inner stillness. When you do use your mind, and
particularly when a creative solution is needed, you oscillate every few minutes or so
between thought and stillness, between mind and no-mind. No-mind is consciousness
without thought. Only in that way is it possible to think creatively, because only in
that way does thought have any real power. Thought alone, when it is no longer
connected with the much vaster realm of consciousness, quickly becomes barren,
insane, destructive.
      The mind is essentially a survival machine. Attack and defense against other
minds, gathering, storing, and analyzing information - this is what it is good at, but it
is not at all creative. All true artists, whether they know it or not, create from a place
of no-mind, from inner stillness. The mind then gives form to the creative impulse or
insight. Even the great scientists have reported that their creative breakthroughs came
at a time of mental quietude. The surprising result of a nation-wide inquiry among
America's most eminent mathematicians, including Einstein, to find out their working
methods, was that thinking "plays only a subordinate part in the brief, decisive phase

                                              20

of the creative act itself."1 So I would say that the simple reason why the majority of
scientists are not creative is not because they don't know how to think but because
they don't know how to stop thinking!
      It wasn't through the mind, through thinking, that the miracle that is life on earth
or your body were created and are being sustained. There is clearly an intelligence at
work that is far greater than the mind. How can a single human cell measuring
1/1,000 of an inch across contain instructions within its DNA that would fill 1,000
books of 600 pages each? The more we learn about the workings of the body, the
more we realize just how vast is the intelligence at work within it and how little we
know. When the mind reconnects with that, it becomes a most wonderful tool. It then
serves something greater than itself.


Emotion: The Body's Reaction to Your Mind
What about emotions? I get caught up in my emotions more than I do in my mind.
Mind, in the way I use the word, is not just thought. It includes your emotions as well
as all unconscious mental-emotional reactive patterns. Emotion arises at the place
where mind and body meet. It is the body's reaction to your mind - or you might say,
a reflection of your mind in the body. For example, an attack thought or a hostile
thought will create a build-up of energy in the body that we call anger. The body is
getting ready to fight. The thought that you are being threatened, physically or
psychologically, causes the body to contract, and this is the physical side of what we
call fear. Research has shown that strong emotions even cause changes in the
biochemistry of the body. These biochemical changes represent the physical or
material aspect of the emotion. Of course, you are not usually conscious of all your
thought patterns, and it is often only through watching your emotions that you can
bring them into awareness.
      The more you are identified with your thinking, your likes and dislikes,
judgments and interpretations, which is to say the less present you are as the watching
consciousness, the stronger the emotional energy charge will be, whether you are
aware of it or not. If you cannot feel your emotions, if you are cut off from them, you
will eventually experience them on a purely physical level, as a physical problem or
symptom. A great deal has been written about this in recent years, so we don't need to
go into it here. A strong unconscious emotional pattern may even manifest as an
external event that appears to just happen to you. For example, I have observed that
people who carry a lot of anger inside without being aware of it and without
expressing it are more likely to be attacked, verbally or even physically, by other



                                           21

angry people, and often for no apparent reason. They have a strong emanation of
anger that certain people pick up subliminally and that triggers their own latent anger.
     If you have difficulty feeling your emotions, start by focusing attention on the
inner energy field of your body. Feel the body from within. This will also put you in
touch with your emotions. We will explore this in more detail later.


You say that an emotion is the mind's reflection in the body. But sometimes there is a
conflict between the two: the mind says "no" while the emotion says "yes," or the
other way around.
     If you really want to know your mind, the body will always give you a truthful
reflection, so look at the emotion or rather feel it in your body. If there is an apparent
conflict between them, the thought will be the lie, the emotion will be the truth. Not
the ultimate truth of who you are, but the relative truth of your state of mind at that
time.
     Conflict between surface thoughts and unconscious mental processes is certainly
common. You may not yet be able to bring your unconscious mind activity into
awareness as thoughts, but it will always be reflected in the body as an emotion, and
of this you can become aware. To watch an emotion in this way is basically the same
as listening to or watching a thought, which I described earlier. The only difference is
that, while a thought is in your head, an emotion has a strong physical component and
so is primarily felt in the body. You can then allow the emotion to be there without
being controlled by it. You no longer are the emotion; you are the watcher, the
observing presence. If you practice this, all that is unconscious in you will be brought
into the light of consciousness.


So observing our emotions is as important as observing our thoughts?
Yes. Make it a habit to ask yourself: What's going on inside me at this moment? That
question will point you in the right direction. But don't analyze, just watch. Focus
your attention within. Feel the energy of the emotion. If there is no emotion present,
take your attention more deeply into the inner energy field of your body. It is the
doorway into Being.
An emotion usually represents an amplified and energized thought pattern, and
because of its often overpowering energetic charge, it is not easy initially to stay
present enough to be able to watch it. It wants to take you over, and it usually
succeeds - unless there is enough presence in you. If you are pulled into unconscious
identification with the emotion through lack of presence, which is normal, the


                                           22

emotion temporarily becomes "you." Often a vicious circle builds up between your
thinking and the emotion: they feed each other. The thought pattern creates a
magnified reflection of itself in the form of an emotion, and the vibrational frequency
of the emotion keeps feeding the original thought pattern. By dwelling mentally on
the situation, event, or person that is the perceived cause of the emotion, the thought
feeds energy to the emotion, which in turn energizes the thought pattern, and so on.
Basically, all emotions are modifications of one primordial, undifferentiated emotion
that has its origin in the loss of awareness of who you are beyond name and form.
Because of its undifferentiated nature, it is hard to find a name that precisely
describes this emotion. "Fear" comes close, but apart from a continuous sense of
threat, it also includes a deep sense of abandonment and incompleteness. It may be
best to use a term that is as undifferentiated as that basic emotion and simply call it
"pain." One of the main tasks of the mind is to fight or remove that emotional pain,
which is one of the reasons for its incessant activity, but all it can ever achieve is to
cover it up temporarily. In fact, the harder the mind struggles to get rid of the pain,
the greater the pain. The mind can never find the solution, nor can it afford to allow
you to find the solution, because it is itself an intrinsic part of the "problem." Imagine
a chief of police trying to find an arsonist when the arsonist is the chief of police.
You will not be free of that pain until you cease to derive your sense of self from
identification with the mind, which is to say from ego. The mind is then toppled from
its place of power and Being reveals itself as your true nature.
Yes, I know what you are going to ask.


I was going to ask: What about positive emotions such as love and joy?
      They are inseparable from your natural state of inner connectedness with Being.
Glimpses of love and joy or brief moments of deep peace are possible whenever a
gap occurs in the stream of thought. For most people, such gaps happen rarely and
only accidentally, in moments when the mind is rendered "speechless," sometimes
triggered by great beauty, extreme physical exertion, or even great danger. Suddenly,
there is inner stillness. And within that stillness there is a subtle but intense joy, there
is love, there is peace.
      Usually, such moments are short-lived, as the mind quickly resumes its noise-
making activity that we call thinking. Love, joy, and peace cannot flourish until you
have freed yourself from mind dominance. But they are not what I would call
emotions. They lie beyond the emotions, on a much deeper level. So you need to
become fully conscious of your emotions and be able to feel them before you can feel



                                             23

that which lies beyond them. Emotion literally means "disturbance." The word comes
from the Latin emovere, meaning "to disturb."
     Love, joy, and peace are deep states of Being or rather three aspects of the state
of inner connectedness with Being. As such, they have no opposite. This is because
they arise from beyond the mind. Emotions, on the other hand, being part of the
dualistic mind, are subject to the law of opposites. This simply means that you cannot
have good without bad. So in the unenlightened, mind-identified condition, what is
sometimes wrongly called joy is the usually short-lived pleasure side of the
continuously alternating pain/pleasure cycle. Pleasure is always derived from
something outside you, whereas joy arises from within. The very thing that gives you
pleasure today will give you pain tomorrow, or it will leave you, so its absence will
give you pain. And what is often referred to as love may be pleasurable and exciting
for a while, but it is an addictive clinging, an extremely needy condition that can turn
into its opposite at the flick of a switch. Many "love" relationships, after the initial
euphoria has passed, actually oscillate between "love" and hate, attraction and attack.
Real love doesn't make you suffer. How could it? It doesn't suddenly turn into hate,
nor does real joy turn into pain. As I said, even before you are enlightened - before
you have freed yourself from your mind - you may get glimpses of true joy, true love,
or of a deep inner peace, still but vibrantly alive. These are aspects of your true
nature, which is usually obscured by the mind. Even within a "normal" addictive
relationship, there can be moments when the presence of something more genuine,
something incorruptible, can be felt. But they will only be glimpses, soon to be
covered up again through mind interference. It may then seem that you had
something very precious and lost it, or your mind may convince you that it was all an
illusion anyway. The truth is that it wasn't an illusion, and you cannot lose it. It is part
of your natural state, which can be obscured but can never be destroyed by the mind.
Even when the sky is heavily overcast, the sun hasn't disappeared. It's still there on
the other side of the clouds.


The Buddha says that pain or suffering arises through desire or craving and that to
be free of pain we need to cut the bonds of desire.
All cravings are the mind seeking salvation or fulfillment in external things and in the
future as a substitute for the joy of Being. As long as I am my mind, I am those
cravings, those needs, wants, attachments, and aversions, and apart from them there is
no "I" except as a mere possibility, an unfulfilled potential, a seed that has not yet
sprouted. In that state, even my desire to become free or enlightened is just another
craving for fulfillment or completion in the future. So don't seek to become free of

                                            24

desire or "achieve" enlightenment. Become present. Be there as the observer of the
mind. Instead of quoting the Buddha, be the Buddha, be "the awakened one," which
is what the word buddha means.
Humans have been in the grip of pain for eons, ever since they fell from the state of
grace, entered the realm of time and mind, and lost awareness of Being. At that point,
they started to perceive themselves as meaningless fragments in an alien universe,
unconnected to the Source and to each other.
Pain is inevitable as long as you are identified with your mind, which is to say as long
as you are unconscious, spiritually speaking. I am talking here primarily of emotional
pain, which is also the main cause of physical pain and physical disease. Resentment,
hatred, self-pity, guilt, anger, depression, jealousy, and so on, even the slightest
irritation, are all forms of pain. And every pleasure or emotional high contains within
itself the seed of pain: its inseparable opposite, which will manifest in time.
Anybody who has ever taken drugs to get "high" will know that the high eventually
turns into a low, that the pleasure turns into some form of pain. Many people also
know from their own experience how easily and quickly an intimate relationship can
turn from a source of pleasure to a source of pain. Seen from a higher perspective,
both the negative and the positive polarities are faces of the same coin, are both part
of the underlying pain that is inseparable from the mind-identified egoic state of
consciousness.
There are two levels to your pain: the pain that you create now, and the pain from the
past that still lives on in your mind and body. Ceasing to create pain in the present
and dissolving past pain - this is what I want to talk about now.

2. CONSCIOUSNESS: THE WAY OUT OF PAIN



Create No More Pain In The Present
Nobody's life is entirely free of pain and sorrow. Isn't it a question of learning to live
with them rather than trying to avoid them?
The greater part of human pain is unnecessary. It is self created as long as the
unobserved mind runs your life.
The pain that you create now is always some form of non acceptance, some form of
unconscious resistance to what is. On the level of thought, the resistance is some
form of judgment. On the emotional level, it is some form of negativity. The intensity
of the pain depends on the degree of resistance to the present moment, and this in turn
depends on how strongly you are identified with your mind. The mind always seeks
to deny the Now and to escape from it. In other words, the more you are identified
with your mind, the more you suffer. Or you may put it like this: the more you are
able to honor and accept the Now, the more you are free of pain, of suffering - and
free of the egoic mind.
Why does the mind habitually deny or resist the Now? Because it cannot function and
remain in control without time, which is past and future, so it perceives the timeless
Now as threatening. Time and mind are in fact inseparable.
Imagine the Earth devoid of human life, inhabited only by plants and animals. Would
it still have a past and a future? Could we still speak of time in any meaningful way?
The question "What time is it?" or "What's the date today?" - if anybody were there to
ask it - would be quite meaningless. The oak tree or the eagle would be bemused by
such a question. "What time?" they would ask. "Well, of course, it's now. The time is
now. What else is there?"
Yes, we need the mind as well as time to function in this world, but there comes a
point where they take over our lives, and this is where dysfunction, pain, and sorrow
set in.
The mind, to ensure that it remains in control, seeks continuously to cover up the
present moment with past and future, and so, as the vitality and infinite creative
potential of Being, which is inseparable from the Now, becomes covered up by time,
your true nature becomes obscured by the mind. An increasingly heavy burden of
time has been accumulating in the human mind. All individuals are suffering under

                                           26

this burden, but they also keep adding to it every moment whenever they ignore or
deny that precious moment or reduce it to a means of getting to some future moment,
which only exists in the mind, never in actuality. The accumulation of time in the
collective and individual human mind also holds a vast amount of residual pain from
the past.
If you no longer want to create pain for yourself and others, if you no longer want to
add to the residue of past pain that still lives on in you, then don't create any more
time, or at least no more than is necessary to deal with the practical aspects of your
life. How to stop creating time? Realize deeply that the present moment is all you
ever have. Make the Now the primary focus of your life. Whereas before you dwelt in
time and paid brief visits to the Now, have your dwelling place in the Now and pay
brief visits to past and future when required to deal with the practical aspects of your
life situation. Always say "yes" to the present moment. What could be more futile,
more insane, than to create inner resistance to something that already is? What could
be more insane than to oppose life itself, which is now and always now? Surrender to
what is. Say "yes" to life - and see how life suddenly starts working for you rather
than against you.


The present moment is sometimes unacceptable, unpleasant, or awful.
It is as it is. Observe how the mind labels it and how this labeling process, this
continuous sitting in judgment, creates pain and unhappiness. By watching the
mechanics of the mind, you step out of its resistance patterns, and you can then allow
the present moment to be. This will give you a taste of the state of inner freedom
from external conditions, the state of true inner peace. Then see what happens, and
take action if necessary or possible.
Accept - then act. Whatever the present moment contains, accept it as if you had
chosen it. Always work with it, not against it. Make it your friend and ally, not your
enemy. This will miraculously transform your whole life.


Past Pain: Dissolving The Pain-Body
As long as you are unable to access the power of the Now, every emotional pain that
you experience leaves behind a residue of pain that lives on in you. It merges with the
pain from the past, which was already there, and becomes lodged in your mind and
body. This, of course, includes the pain you suffered as a child, caused by the
unconsciousness of the world into which you were born.




                                           27

This accumulated pain is a negative energy field that occupies your body and mind. If
you look on it as an invisible entity in its own right, you are getting quite close to the
truth. Its the emotional pain-body. It has two modes of being: dormant and active. A
pain-body may be dormant 90 percent of the time; in a deeply unhappy person,
though, it may be active up to 100 percent of the time. Some people live almost
entirely through their pain-body, while others may experience it only in certain
situations, such as intimate relationships, or situations linked with past loss or
abandonment, physical or emotional hurt, and so on. Anything can trigger it,
particularly if it resonates with a pain pattern from your past. When it is ready to
awaken from its dormant stage, even a thought or an innocent remark made by
someone close to you can activate it.
Some pain-bodies are obnoxious but relatively harmless, for example like a child who
won' t stop whining. Others are vicious and destructive monsters, true demons. Some
are physically violent; many more are emotionally violent. Some will attack people
around you or close to you, while others may attack you, their host. Thoughts and
feelings you have about your life then become deeply negative and self-destructive.
Illnesses and accidents are often created in this way. Some pain-bodies drive their
hosts to suicide.
When you thought you knew a person and then you are suddenly confronted with this
alien, nasty creature for the first time, you are in for quite a shock. However, it's more
important to observe it in yourself than in someone else. Watch out for any sign of
unhappiness in yourself, in whatever form - it may be the awakening pain-body. This
can take the form of irritation, impatience, a somber mood, a desire to hurt, anger,
rage, depression, a need to have some drama in your relationship, and so on. Catch it
the moment it awakens from its dormant state.
The pain-body wants to survive, just like every other entity in existence, and it can
only survive if it gets you to unconsciously identify with it. It can then rise up, take
you over, "become you," and live through you. It needs to get its "food" through you.
It will feed on any experience that resonates with its own kind of energy, anything
that creates further pain in whatever form: anger, destructiveness, hatred, grief,
emotional drama, violence, and even illness. So the pain-body, when it has taken you
over, will create a situation in your life that reflects back its own energy frequency for
it to feed on. Pain can only feed on pain. Pain cannot feed on joy. It finds it quite
indigestible.
Once the pain-body has taken you over, you want more pain. You become a victim or
a perpetrator. You want to inflict pain, or you want to suffer pain, or both. There isn't
really much difference between the two. You are not conscious of this, of course, and

                                             28

will vehemently claim that you do not want pain. But look closely and you will find
that your thinking and behavior are designed to keep the pain going, for yourself and
others. If youweretruly conscious of it, the pattern would dissolve, for to want more
pain is insanity, and nobody is consciously insane.
The pain-body, which is the dark shadow cast by the ego, is actually afraid of the
light of your consciousness. It is afraid of being found out. Its survival depends on
your unconscious identification with it, as well as on your unconscious fear of facing
the pain that lives in you. But if you don't face it, if you don' t bring the light of your
consciousness into the pain, you will be forced to relive it again and again. The pain-
body may seem to you like a dangerous monster that you cannot bear to look at, but I
assure you that it is an insubstantial phantom that cannot prevail against the power of
your presence.
Some spiritual teachings state that all pain is ultimately an illusion, and this is true.
The question is: Is it true for you? A mere belief doesn't make it true. Do you want to
experience pain for the rest of your life and keep saying that it is an illusion? Does
that free you from the pain? What we are concerned with here is how you can realize
this truth - that is, make it real in your own experience.
So the pain-body doesn't want you to observe it directly and see it for what it is. The
moment you observe it, feel its energy field within you, and take your attention into
it, the identification is broken. A higher dimension of consciousness has come in. I
call it presence. You are now the witness or the watcher of the pain-body. This means
that it cannot use you anymore by pretending to be you, and it can no longer replenish
itself through you. You have found your own innermost strength. You have accessed
the power of Now.


What happens to the pain-body when we become conscious enough to break our
identification with it?
Unconsciousness creates it; consciousness transmutes it into itself. St. Paul expressed
this universal principle beautifully: "Everything is shown up by being exposed to the
light, and whatever is exposed to the light itself becomes light." Just as you cannot
fight the darkness, you cannot fight the pain-body. Trying to do so would create inner
conflict and thus further pain. Watching it is enough. Watching it implies accepting it
as part of what is at that moment.
The pain-body consists of trapped life-energy that has split off from your total energy
field and has temporarily become autonomous through the unnatural process of mind
identification. It has turned in on itself and become anti-life, like an animal trying to


                                             29

devour its own tail. Why do you think our civilization has become so life-destructive?
But even the life-destructive forces are still life-energy.
When you start to disidentify and become the watcher, the painbody will continue to
operate for a while and will try to trick you into identifying with it again. Although
you are no longer energizing it through your identification, it has a certain
momentum, just like a spinning wheel that will keep turning for a while even when it
is no longer being propelled. At this stage, it may also create physical aches and pains
in different parts of the body, but they won't last. Stay present, stay conscious. Be the
ever-alert guardian of your inner space. You need to be present enough to be able to
watch the pain-body directly and feel its energy. It then cannot control your thinking.
The moment your thinking is aligned with the energy field of the painbody, you are
identified with it and again feeding it with your thoughts.
For example, if anger is the predominant energy vibration of the pain-body and you
think angry thoughts, dwelling on what someone did to you or what you are going to
do to him or her, then you have become unconscious, and the pain-body has become
"you." Where there is anger, there is always pain underneath. Or when a dark mood
comes upon you and you start getting into a negative mind-pattern and thinking how
dreadful your life is, your thinking has become aligned with the pain-body, and you
have become unconscious and vulnerable to the pain-body's attack. "Unconscious,"
the way that I use the word here, means to be identified with some mental or emo-
tional pattern. It implies a complete absence of the watcher.
Sustained conscious attention severs the link between the painbody and your thought
processes and brings about the process of transmutation. It is as if the pain becomes
fuel for the flame of your consciousness, which then burns more brightly as a result.
This is the esoteric meaning of the ancient art of alchemy. the transmutation of base
metal into gold, of suffering into consciousness. The split within is healed, and you
become whole again. Your responsibility then is not to create further pain.
Let me summarize the process. Focus attention on the feeling inside you. Know that
it is the pain-body. Accept that it is there. Don't think about it - don't let the feeling
turn into thinking. Don't judge or analyze. Don't make an identity for yourself out of
it. Stay present, and continue to be the observer of what is happening inside you.
Become aware not only of the emotional pain but also of "the one who observes," the
silent watcher. This is the power of the Now, the power of your own conscious
presence. Then see what happens.
For many women, the pain-body awakens particularly at the time preceding the
menstrual flow. I will talk about this and the reason for it in more detail later. Right
now, let me just say this: If you are able to stay alert and present at that time and

                                            30

watch whatever you feel within, rather than be taken over by it, it affords an
opportunity for the most powerful spiritual practice, and a rapid transmutation of all
past pain becomes possible.


Ego Identification With The Pain-Body
The process that I have just described is profoundly powerful yet simple. It could be
taught to a child, and hopefully one day it will be one of the first things children learn
in school. Once you have understood the basic principle of being present as the
watcher of what happens inside you - and you "understand" it by experiencing it -
you have at your disposal the most potent transformational tool.
This is not to deny that you may encounter intense inner resistance to disidentifying
from your pain. This will be the case particularly if you have lived closely identified
with your emotional pain-body for most of your life and the whole or a large part of
your sense of self is invested in it. What this means is that you have made an unhappy
self out of your pain-body and believe that this mind-made fiction is who you are. In
that case, unconscious fear of losing your identity will create strong resistance to any
disidentification. In other words, you would rather be in pain ­be the pain-body­
than take a leap into the unknown and risk losing the familiar unhappy self.
If this applies to you, observe the resistance within yourself. Observe the attachment
to your pain. Be very alert. Observe the peculiar pleasure you derive from being
unhappy. Observe the compulsion to talk or think about it. The resistance will cease
if you make it conscious. You can then take your attention into the pain-body, stay
present as the witness, and so initiate its transmutation.
Only you can do this. Nobody can do it for you. But if you are fortunate enough to
find someone who is intensely conscious, if you can be with them and join them in
the state of presence, that can be helpful and will accelerate things. In this way, your
own light will quickly grow stronger. When a log that has only just started to burn is
placed next to one that is burning fiercely, and after a while they are separated again,
the first log will be burning with much greater intensity. After all, it is the same fire.
To be such a fire is one of the functions of a spiritual teacher. Some therapists may
also be able to fulfill that function, provided that they have gone beyond the level of
mind and can create and sustain a state of intense conscious presence while they are
working with you.


The Origin Of Fear
You mentioned fear as being part of our basic underlying emotional pain. How does
fear arise, and why is there so much of it in people's lives? And isn't a certain amount

                                              31

of fear just healthy self-protection? If I didn't have a fear of fire, I might put
my hand in it and get burned.
The reason why you don't put your hand in the fire is not because of fear, it's because
you know that you'll get burned. You don't need fear to avoid unnecessary danger -
just a minimum of intelligence and common sense. For such practical matters, it is
useful to apply the lessons learned in the past. Now if someone threatened you with
fire or with physical violence, you might experience something like fear. This is an
instinctive shrinking back from danger, but not the psychological condition of fear
that we are talking about here. The psychological condition of fear is divorced from
any concrete and true immediate danger. It comes in many forms: unease, worry,
anxiety, nervousness, tension, dread, phobia, and so on. This kind of psychological
fear is always of something that might happen, not of something that is happening
now. You are in the here and now, while your mind is in the future. This creates an
anxiety gap. And if you are identified with your mind and have lost touch with the
power and simplicity of the Now, that anxiety gap will be your constant companion.
You can always cope with the present moment, but you cannot cope with something
that is only a mind projection - you cannot cope with the future.
Moreover, as long as you are identified with your mind, the ego runs your life, as I
pointed out earlier. Because of its phantom nature, and despite elaborate defense
mechanisms, the ego is very vulnerable and insecure, and it sees itself as constantly
under threat. This, by the way, is the case even if the ego is outwardly very confident.
Now remember that an emotion is the body's reaction to your mind. What message is
the body receiving continuously from the ego, the false, mind-made self? Danger, I
am under threat. And what is the emotion generated by this continuous message?
Fear, of course.
Fear seems to have many causes. Fear of loss, fear of failure, fear of being hurt, and
so on, but ultimately all fear is the ego's fear of death, of annihilation. To the ego,
death is always just around the corner. In this mind-identified state, fear of death
affects every aspect of your life. For example, even such a seemingly trivial and
"normal" thing as the compulsive need to be right in an argument and make the other
person wrong - defending the mental position with which you have identified - is due
to the fear of death. If you identify with a mental position, then if you are wrong,
your mind-based sense of self is seriously threatened with annihilation. So you as the
ego cannot afford to be wrong. To be wrong is to die. Wars have been fought over
this, and countless relationships have broken down.
Once you have disidentified from your mind, whether you are right or wrong makes
no difference to your sense of self at all, so the forcefully compulsive and deeply

                                           32

unconscious need to be right, which is a form of violence, will no longer be there.
You can state clearly and firmly how you feel or what you think, but there will be no
aggressiveness or defensiveness about it. Your sense of self is then derived from a
deeper and truer place within yourself, not from the mind. Watch out for any kind of
defensiveness within yourself. What are you defending? An illusory identity, an
image in your mind, a fictitious entity. By making this pattern conscious, by
witnessing it, you disidentify from it. In the light of your consciousness, the uncon-
scious pattern will then quickly dissolve. This is the end of all arguments and power
games, which are so corrosive to relationships. Power over others is weakness
disguised as strength. True power is within, and it is available to you now.
So anyone who is identified with their mind and, therefore, disconnected from their
true power, their deeper self rooted in Being, will have fear as their constant
companion. The number of people who have gone beyond mind is as yet extremely
small, so you can assume that virtually everyone you meet or know lives in a state of
fear. Only the intensity of it varies. It fluctuates between anxiety and dread at one end
of the scale and a vague unease and distant sense of threat at the other. Most people
become conscious of it only when it takes on one of its more acute forms.


The Ego's Search For Wholeness
Another aspect of the emotional pain that is an intrinsic part of the egoic mind is a
deep-seated sense of lack or incompleteness, of not being whole. In some people, this
is conscious, in others unconscious. If it is conscious, it manifests as the unsettling
and constant feeling of not being worthy or good enough. If it is unconscious, it will
only be felt indirectly as an intense craving, wanting and needing. In either case,
people will often enter into a compulsive pursuit of ego-gratification and things to
identify with in order to fill this hole they feel within. So they strive after possessions,
money, success, power, recognition, or a special relationship, basically so that they
can feel better about themselves, feel more complete. But even when they attain all
these things, they soon find that the hole is still there, that it is bottomless. Then they
are really in trouble, because they cannot delude themselves anymore. Well, they can
and do, but it gets more difficult.
As long as the egoic mind is running your life, you cannot truly be at ease; you
cannot be at peace or fulfilled except for brief intervals when you obtained what you
wanted, when a craving has just been fulfilled. Since the ego is a derived sense of
self, it needs to identify with external things. It needs to be both defended and fed
constantly. The most common ego identifications have to do with possessions, the
work you do, social status and recognition, knowledge and education, physical


                                              33

appearance, special abilities, relationships, personal and family history, belief
systems, and often also political, nationalistic, racial, religious, and other collective
identifications. None of these is you.
Do you find this frightening? Or is it a relief to know this? All of these things you
will have to relinquish sooner or later. Perhaps you find it as yet hard to believe, and I
am certainly not asking you to believe that your identity cannot be found in any of
those things. You will know the truth of it for yourself. You will know it at the latest
when you feel death approaching. Death is a stripping away of all that is not you. The
secret of life is to "die before you die" - and find that there is no death.




                                             34

3. MOVING DEEPLY INTO THE NOW



Don't Seek Your Self In The Mind
I feel that there is still a great deal I need to learn about the workings of my mind
before I can get anywhere near full consciousness or spiritual enlightenment.
No, you don't. The problems of the mind cannot be solved on the level of the mind.
Once you have understood the basic dysfunction, there isn't really much else that you
need to learn or understand. Studying the complexities of the mind may make you a
good psychologist, but doing so wont take you beyond the mind, just as the study of
madness isn't enough to create sanity. You have already understood the basic
mechanics of the unconscious state: identification with the mind, which creates a
false self, the ego, as a substitute for your true self rooted in Being. You become as a
"branch cut off from the vine," as Jesus puts it.
The ego's needs are endless. It feels vulnerable and threatened and so lives in a state
of fear and want. Once you know how the basic dysfunction operates, there is no
need to explore all its countless manifestations, no need to make it into a complex
personal problem. The ego, of course, loves that. It is always seeking for something
to attach itself to in order to uphold and strengthen its illusory sense of self, and it
will readily attach itself to your problems. This is why, for so many people, a large
part of their sense of self is intimately connected with their problems. Once this has
happened, the last thing they want is tobecome free of them; that would mean loss of
self. There can be a great deal of unconscious ego investment in pain and suffering.
So once you recognize the root of unconsciousness as identification with the mind,
which of course includes the emotions, you step out of it. You become present. When
you are present, you can allow the mind to be as it is without getting entangled in it.
The mind in itself is not dysfunctional. It is a wonderful tool. Dysfunction sets in
when you seek your self in it and mistake it for who you are. It then becomes the
egoic mind and takes over your whole life.


End The Delusion Of Time
It seems almost impossible to disidentify from the mind. We are all immersed in it.
How do you teach a fish to fly?



                                             35

Here is the key: End the delusion of time. Time and mind are inseparable. Remove
time from the mind and it stops - unless you choose to use it.
To be identified with your mind is to be trapped in time: the compulsion to live
almost exclusively through memory and anticipation. This creates an endless
preoccupation with past and future and an unwillingness to honor and acknowledge
the resent moment and allow it to be. The compulsion arises because the past gives
you an identity and the future holds the promise of salvation, of fulfillment in
whatever form. Both are illusions.


But without a sense of time, how would we function in this world? There would be no
goals to strive toward anymore. I wouldn't even know who I am, because my past
makes me who I am today. I think time is something very precious, and we need to
learn to use it wisely rather than waste it.
Time isn't precious at all, because it is an illusion. What you perceive as precious is
not time but the one point that is out of time: the Now. That is precious indeed. The
more you are focused on time - past and future - the more you miss the Now, the
most precious thing there is. Why is it the most precious thing? Firstly, because it is
the only thing. It's all there is. The eternal present is the space within which your
whole life unfolds, the one factor that remains constant. Life is now. There was never
a time when your life was not now, nor will there ever be. Secondly, the Now is the
only point that can take you beyond the limited confines of the mind. It is your only
point of access into the timeless and formless realm of Being.


Nothing Exists Outside The Now
Aren't past and future just as real, sometimes even more real, than the present? After
all, the past determines who we are, as well as how we perceive and behave in the
present. And our future goals determine which actions we take in the present.
You haven't yet grasped the essence of what I am saying because you are trying to
understand it mentally. The mind cannot understand this. Only you can. Please just
listen.
Have you ever experienced, done, thought, or felt anything outside the Now? Do you
think you ever will? Is it possible for anything to happen or be outside the Now? The
answer is obvious, is it not? Nothing ever happened in the past; it happened in the
Now. Nothing will ever happen in the future; it will happen in the Now. What you
think of as the past is a memory trace, stored in the mind, of a former Now. When
you remember the past, you reactivate a memory trace - and you do so now. The


                                            36

future is an imagined Now, a projection of the mind. When the future comes, it
comes as the Now. When you think about the future, you do it now. Past and future
obviously have no reality of their own. Just as the moon has no light of its own, but
can only reflect the light of the sun, so are past and future only pale reflections of the
light, power, and reality of the eternal present. Their reality is "borrowed" from the
Now.
The essence of what I am saying here cannot be understood by the mind. The
moment you grasp it, there is a shift in consciousness from mind to Being, from time
to presence. Suddenly, everything feels alive, radiates energy, emanates Being.


The Key To The Spiritual Dimension
In life-threatening emergency situations, the shift in consciousness from time to
presence sometimes happens naturally. The personality that has a past and a future
momentarily recedes and is replaced by an intense conscious presence, very still but
very alert at the same time. Whatever response is needed then arises out of that state
of consciousness.
The reason why some people love to engage in dangerous activities, such as
mountain climbing, car racing, and so on, although they may not be aware of it, is
that it forces them into the Now - that intensely alive state that is free of time, free of
problems, free of thinking, free of the burden of the personality. Slipping away from
the present moment even for a second may mean death. Unfortunately, they come to
depend on a particular activity to be in that state. But you don' t need to climb the
north face of the Eiger. You can enter that state now.
Since ancient times, spiritual masters of all traditions have pointed to the Now as the
key to the spiritual dimension. Despite this, it seems to have remained a secret. It is
certainly not taught in churches and temples. If you go to a church, you may hear
readings from the Gospels such as "Take no thought for the morrow; for the morrow
shall take thought for the things of itself," or "Nobody who puts his hands to the plow
and looks back is fit for the Kingdom of God." Or you might hear the passage about
the beautiful flowers that are not anxious about tomorrow but live with ease in the
timeless Now and are provided for abundantly by God. The depth and radical nature
of these teachings are not recognized. No one seems to realize that they are meant to
be lived and so bring about a profound inner transformation. The whole essence of
Zen consists in walking along the razor's edge of Now - to be so utterly, so
completely present that no problem, no suffering, nothing that is not who you are in
your essence, can survive in you. In the Now, in the absence of time, all your
problems dissolve. Suffering needs time; it cannot survive in the Now.

                                             37

The great Zen master Rinzai, in order to take his students' attention away from time,
would often raise his finger and slowly ask: "What, at this moment, is lacking?" A
powerful question that does not require an answer on the level of the mind. It is
designed to take your attention deeply into the Now. A similar question in the Zen
tradition is this: "If not now, when?"
The Now is also central to the teaching of Sufism, the mystical branch of Islam. Sufis
have a saying: "The Sufi is the son of time present." And Rumi, the great poet and
teacher of Sufism, declares: "Past and future veil God from our sight; burn up both of
them with fire."
Meister Eckhart, the thirteenth-century spiritual teacher, summed it all up beautifully:
"Time is what keeps the light from reaching us. There is no greater obstacle to God
than time."


Accessing The Power Of The Now
A moment ago, when you talked about the eternal present and the unreality of past
and future, I found myself looking at that tree outside the window. I had looked at it a
few times before, but this time it was different. The external perception had not
changed much, except that the colors seemed brighter and more vibrant. But there
was now an added dimension to it. This is hard to explain. I don't know how, but 1
was aware of something invisible that I felt was the essence of that tree, its inner
spirit, if you like. And somehow I was part of that. I realize. now that I hadn't truly
seen the tree before, just a flat and dead image of it. When I look at the tree now,
some of that awareness is still present, but I can feel it slipping away. You see, the
experience is already receding into the past. Can something like this ever be more
than a fleeting glimpse?
You were free of time for a moment. You moved into the Now and therefore
perceived the tree without the screen of mind. The awareness of Being became part of
your perception. With the timeless dimension comes a different kind of knowing, one
that does not "kill" the spirit that lives within every creature and every thing. A
knowing that does not destroy the sacredness and mystery of life but contains a deep
love and reverence for all that is. A knowing of which the mind knows nothing.
The mind cannot know the tree. It can only know facts or information about the tree.
My mind cannot know you, only labels, judgments, facts, and opinions about you.
Being alone knows directly.
There is a place for mind and mind knowledge. It is in the practical realm of day-to-
day living. However, when it takes over all aspects of your life, including your
relationships with other human beings and with nature, it becomes a monstrous

                                           38

parasite that, unchecked, may well end up killing all life on the planet and finally
itself by killing its host.
You have had a glimpse of how the timeless can transform your perceptions. But an
experience is not enough, no matter how beautiful or profound. What is needed and
what we are concerned with is a permanent shift in consciousness.
So break the old pattern of present-moment denial and present moment resistance.
Make it your practice to withdraw attention from past and future whenever they are
not needed. Step out of the time dimension as much as possible in everyday life. If
you find it hard to enter the Now directly, start by observing the habitual tendency of
your mind to want to escape from the Now. You will observe that the future is
usually imagined as either better or worse than the present. If the imagined future is
better, it gives you hope or pleasurable anticipation. If it is worse, it creates anxiety.
Both are illusory. Through self-observation, more presence comes into your life
automatically. The moment you realize you are not present, you are present.
Whenever you are able to observe your mind, you are no longer trapped in it. Another
factor has come in, something that is not of the mind: the witnessing presence.
Be present as the watcher of your mind - of your thoughts and emotions as well as
your reactions in various situations. Be at least as interested in your reactions as in
the situation or person that causes you to react. Notice also how often your attention
is in the past or future. Don't judge or analyze what you observe. Watch the thought,
feel the emotion, observe the reaction. Don't make a personal problem out of them.
You will then feel something more powerful than any of those things that you
observe: the still, observing presence itself behind the content of your mind, the silent
watcher.
Intense presence is needed when certain situations trigger a reaction with a strong
emotional charge, such as when your self-image is threatened, a challenge comes into
your life that triggers fear, things "go wrong," or an emotional complex from the past
is brought up. In those instances, the tendency is for you to become "unconscious."
The reaction or emotion takes you over - you "become" it. You act it out. You justify,
make wrong, attack, defend ... except that it isn't you, it's the reactive pattern, the
mind in its habitual survival mode.
Identification with the mind gives it more energy; observation of the mind withdraws
energy from it. Identification with the mind creates more time; observation of the
mind opens up the dimension of the timeless. The energy that is withdrawn from the
mind turns into presence. Once you can feel what it means to be present, it becomes
much easier to simply choose to step out of the time dimension whenever time is not
needed for practical purposes and move more deeply into the Now. This does not

                                            39

impair your ability to use time - past or future - when you need to refer to it for
practical matters. Nor does it impair your ability to use your mind. In fact, it enhances
it. When you do use your mind, it will be sharper, more focused.


Letting Go Of Psychological Time
Learn to use time in the practical aspects of your life - we may call this "clock time" -
but immediately return to present-moment awareness when those practical matters
have been dealt with. In this way, there will be no build-up of "psychological time,"
which is identification with the past and continuous compulsive projection into the
future.
Clock time is not just making an appointment or planning a trip. It includes learning
from the past so that we don't repeat the same mistakes over and over. Setting goals
and working toward them. Predicting the future by means of patterns and laws,
physical, mathematical and so on, learned from the past and taking appropriate action
on the basis of our predictions.
But even here, within the sphere of practical living, where we cannot do without
reference to past and future, the present moment remains the essential factor: Any
lesson from the past becomes relevant and is applied now. Any planning as well as
working toward achieving a particular goal is done now.
The enlightened persons main focus of attention is always the Now, but they are still
peripherally aware of time. In other words, they continue to use clock time but are
free of psychological time.
Be alert as you practice this so that you do not unwittingly transform clock time into
psychological time. For example, if you made a mistake in the past and learn from it
now, you are using clock time. On the other hand, if you dwell on it mentally, and
self-criticism, remorse, or guilt come up, then you are making the mistake into "me"
and "mine": you make it part of your sense of self, and it has become psychological
time, which is always linked to a false sense of identity. Non-forgiveness necessarily
implies a heavy burden of psychological time.
If you set yourself a goal and work toward it, you are using clock time. You are
aware of where you want to go, but you honor and give your fullest attention to the
step that you are taking at this moment. If you then become excessively focused on
the goal, perhaps because you are seeking happiness, fulfillment, or a more complete
sense of self in it, the Now is no longer honored. It becomes reduced to a mere
stepping stone to the future, with no intrinsic value. Clock time then turns into
psychological time. Your life's journey is no longer an adventure, just an obsessive
need to arrive, to attain, to "make it." You no longer see or smell the flowers by the

                                           40

wayside either, nor are you aware of the beauty and the miracle of life that unfolds all
around you when you are present in the Now.


I can see the supreme importance of the Now, but I cannot quite go along with you
when you say that time is a complete illusion.
When I say "time is an illusion," my intention is not to make a philosophical
statement. I am just reminding you of a simple fact - a fact so obvious that you may
find it hard to grasp and may even find it meaningless - but once fully realized, it can
cut like a sword through all the mind-created layers of complexity and "problems."
Let me say it again: the present moment is all you ever have. There is never a time
when your life is not "this moment." Is this not a fact?


The Insanity Of Psychological Time
You will not have any doubt that psychological time is a mental disease if you look at
its collective manifestations. They occur, for example, in the form of ideologies such
as communism, national socialism or any nationalism, or rigid religious belief
systems, which operate under the implicit assumption that the highest good lies in the
future and that therefore the end justifies the means. The end is an idea, a point in the
mind-projected future, when salvation in whatever form - happiness, fulfillment,
equality, liberation, and so on - will be attained. Not infrequently, the means of
getting there are the enslavement, torture, and murder of people in the present.
For example, it is estimated that as many as 50 million people were murdered to
further the cause of communism, to bring about a "better world" in Russia, China,
and other countries. This is a chilling example of how belief in a future heaven
creates a present hell. Can there be any doubt that psychological time is a serious and
dangerous mental illness?
How does this mind pattern operate in your life? Are you always trying to get
somewhere other than where you are? Is most of your doing just a means to an end?
Is fulfillment always just around the corner or confined to short-lived pleasures, such
as sex, food, drink, drugs, or thrills and excitement? Are you always focused on
becoming, achieving, and attaining, or alternatively chasing some new thrill or
pleasure? Do you believe that if you acquire more things you will become more
fulfilled, good enough, or psychologically complete? Are you waiting for a man or
woman to give meaning to your life?
In the normal, mind-identified or unenlightened state of consciousness, the
power and infinite creative potential that lie concealed in the Now are


                                            41

completely obscured by psychological time. Your life then loses its vibrancy,
its freshness, its sense of wonder. The old patterns of thought, emotion,
behavior, reaction, and desire are acted out in endless repeat performances, a
script in your mind that gives you an identity of sorts but distorts or covers up
the reality of the Now. The mind then creates an obsession with the future as an
escape from the unsatisfactory present.


Negativity And Suffering Have Their Roots In Time
But the belief that the future will be better than the present is not always an illusion.
The present can be dreadful, and things can get better in the future, and often they do.
Usually, the future is a replica of the past. Superficial changes are possible, but real
transformation is rare and depends upon whether you can become present enough to
dissolve the past by accessing the power of the Now. What you perceive as future is
an intrinsic part of your state of consciousness now. If your mind carries a heavy
burden of past, you will experience more of the same. The past perpetuates itself
through lack of presence. The quality of your consciousness at this moment is what
shapes the future - which, of course, can only be experienced as the Now.
You may win $10 million, but that kind of change is no more than skin deep. You
would simply continue to act out the same conditioned patterns in more luxurious
surroundings. Humans have learned to split the atom. Instead of killing ten or twenty
people with a wooden club, one person can now kill a million just by pushing a
button. Is that real change?
If it is the quality of your consciousness at this moment that determines the future,
then what is it that determines the quality of your consciousness? Your degree of
presence. So the only place where true change can occur and where the past can be
dissolved is the Now.
All negativity is caused by an accumulation of psychological time and denial of the
present. Unease, anxiety, tension, stress, worry - all forms of fear - are caused by too
much future, and not enough presence. Guilt, regret, resentment, grievances, sadness,
bitterness, and all forms of non-forgiveness are caused by too much past, and not
enough presence.
Most people find it difficult to believe that a state of consciousness totally free of all
negativity is possible. And yet this is the liberated state to which all spiritual
teachings point. It is the promise of salvation, not in an illusory future but right here
and now.




                                            42

You may find it hard to recognize that time is the cause of your suffering or your
problems. You believe that they are caused by specific situations in your life, and
seen from a conventional viewpoint, this is true. But until you have dealt with the
basic problem-making dysfunction of the mind - its attachment to past and future and
denial of the Now - problems are actually interchangeable. If all your problems or
perceived causes of suffering or unhappiness were miraculously removed for you
today, but you had not become more present, more conscious, you would soon find
yourself with a similar set of problems or causes of suffering, like a shadow that
follows you wherever you go. Ultimately, there is only one problem: the time bound
mind itself.


I cannot believe that I could ever reach a point where I am completely free of my
problems.
You are right. You can never reach that point because you are at that point now.
There is no salvation in time. You cannot be free in the future. Presence is the key to
freedom, so you can only be free now.


Finding The Life Underneath Your Life Situation
I don't see how I can be free now. As it happens, I am extremely unhappy with my life
at the moment. This is a fact, and I would be deluding myself if I tried to convince
myself that all is well when it definitely isn't. To me, the present moment is very
unhappy; it is not liberating at all. What keeps me going is the hope or possibility of
some improvement in the future.
You think that your attention is in the present moment when it's actually taken up
completely by time. You cannot be both unhappy and fully present in the Now.
What you refer to as your "life" should more accurately be called your "life
situation." It is psychological time: past and future. Certain things in the past didn't go
the way you wanted them to go. You are still resisting what happened in the past, and
now you are resisting what is. Hope is what keeps you going, but hope keeps you
focused on the future, and this continued focus perpetuates your denial of the Now
and therefore your unhappiness.


It is true that my present life situation is the result of things that happened in the past,
but it is still my present situation, and being stuck in it is what makes me unhappy.
Forget about your life situation for a while and pay attention to your life. What is the
difference?


                                              43

Your life situation exists in time. Your life is now.
Your life situation is mind-stuff. Your life is real.
Find the "narrow gate that leads to life." It is called the Now. Narrow your life down
to this moment. Your life situation may be full of problems - most life situations are -
but find out if you have any problem at this moment. Not tomorrow or in ten minutes,
but now. Do you have a problem now?
When you are full of problems, there is no room for anything new to enter, no room
for a solution. So whenever you can, make some room, create some space, so that you
find the life underneath your life situation.
Use your senses fully. Be where you are. Look around. Just look, don't interpret. See
the light, shapes, colors, textures. Be aware of the silent presence of each thing. Be
aware of the space that allows everything to be. Listen to the sounds; don't judge
them. Listen to the silence underneath the sounds. Touch something - anything - and
feel and acknowledge its Being. Observe the rhythm of your breathing; feel the air
flowing in and out, feel the life energy inside your body. Allow everything to be,
within and without. Allow the "isness" of all things. Move deeply into the Now.
You are leaving behind the deadening world of mental abstraction, of time. You are
getting out of the insane mind that is draining you of life energy, just as it is slowly
poisoning and destroying the Earth. You are awakening out of the dream of time into
the present.


All Problems Are Illusions Of The Mind
It feels as if a heavy burden has been lifted. A sense of lightness. I feel clear... but my
problems are still there waiting for me, aren't they? They haven't been solved. Am I
not just temporarily evading them?
If you found yourself in paradise, it wouldn't be long before your mind would say
"yes, but...."
Ultimately, this is not about solving your problems. It's about realizing that there are
no problems. Only situations - to be dealt with now, or to be left alone and accepted
as part of the "isness" of the present moment until they change or can be dealt with.
Problems are mind-made and need time to survive. They cannot survive in the
actuality of the Now.
Focus your attention on the Now and tell me what problem you have at this moment.
I am not getting any answer because it is impossible to have a problem when your
attention is fully in the Now. A situation that needs to be either dealt with or accepted
- yes. Why make it into a problem? Why make anything into a problem? Isn't life


                                            44

challenging enough as it is? What do you need problems for? The mind
unconsciously loves problems because they give you an identity of sorts. This is
normal, and it is insane. "Problem" means that you are dwelling on a situation
mentally without there being a true intention or possibility of taking action now and
that you are unconsciously making it part of your sense of self. You become so
overwhelmed by your life situation that you lose your sense of life, of Being. Or you
are carrying in your mind the insane burden of a hundred things that you will or may
have to do in the future instead of focusing your attention on the one thing that you
can do now.
When you create a problem, you create pain. All it takes is a simple choice, a simple
decision: no matter what happens, I will create no more pain for myself. I will create
no more problems. Although it is a simple choice, it is also very radical. You won' t
make that choice unless you are truly fed up with suffering, unless you have truly had
enough. And you won't be able to go through with it unless you access the power of
the Now. If you create no more pain for yourself, then you create no more pain for
others. You also no longer contaminate the beautiful Earth, your inner space, and the
collective human psyche with the negativity of problem-making.
If you have ever been in a life-or-death emergency situation, you will know that it
wasn't a problem. The mind didn't have time to fool around and make it into a
problem. In a true emergency, the mind stops; you become totally present in the Now,
and something infinitely more powerful takes over. This is why there are many
reports of ordinary people suddenly becoming capable of incredibly courageous
deeds. In any emergency, either you survive or you don't. Either way, it is not a
problem.
Some people get angry when they hear me say that problems are illusions. I am
threatening to take away their sense of who they are. They have invested much time
in a false sense of self. For many years, they have unconsciously defined their whole
identity in terms of' their problems or their suffering. Who would they be without it?
A great deal of what people say, think, or do is actually motivated by fear, which of
course is always linked with having your focus on the future and being out of touch
with the Now. As there are no problems in the Now, there is no fear either.
Should a situation arise that you need to deal with now, your action will be clear and
incisive if it arises out of present-moment awareness. It is also more likely to be
effective. It will not be a reaction coming from the past conditioning of your mind but
an intuitive response to the situation. In other instances, when the time-bound mind
would have reacted, you will find it more effective to do nothing - just stay centered
in the Now.

                                            45

A Quantum Leap In The Evolution Of Consciousness
I have had glimpses of this state of freedom from mind and time that you describe, but
past and future are so overwhelmingly strong that I cannot keep them out for long.
The time-bound mode of consciousness is deeply embedded in the human psyche.
But what we are doing here is part of a profound transformation that is taking place in
the collective consciousness of the planet and beyond: the awakening of
consciousness from the dream of matter, form, and separation. The ending of time.
We are breaking mind patterns that have dominated human life for eons. Mind pat-
terns that have created unimaginable suffering on a vast scale. I am not using the
word evil. It is more helpful to call it unconsciousness or insanity.


This breaking up of the old mode of consciousness or rather unconsciousness: is it
                 -

something we have to do or will it happen anyway? I mean, is this change inevitable?
That's a question of perspective. The doing and the happening is in fact a single
process; because you are one with the totality of consciousness, you cannot separate
the two. But there is no absolute guarantee that humans will make it. The process isn't
inevitable or automatic. Your cooperation is an essential part of it. However you look
at it, it is a quantum leap in the evolution of consciousness, as well as our only chance
of survival as a race.


The Joy Of Being
To alert you that you have allowed yourself to be taken over by psychological time,
you can use a simple criterion. Ask yourself: Is there joy, ease, and lightness in what I
am doing? If there isn't, then time is covering up the present moment, and life is
perceived as a burden or a struggle.
If there is no joy, ease, or lightness in what you are doing, it does not necessarily
mean that you need to change what you are doing. It may be sufficient to change the
how. "How" is always more important than "what." See if you can give much more
attention to the doing than to the result that you want to achieve through it. Give your
fullest attention to whatever the moment presents. This implies that you also
completely accept what is, because you cannot give your full attention to something
and at the same time resist it.
As soon as you honor the present moment, all unhappiness and struggle dissolve, and
life begins to flow with joy and ease. When you act out of present-moment
awareness, whatever you do becomes imbued with a sense of quality, care, and love -
even the most simple action.


                                             46

So do not be concerned with the fruit of your action - just give attention to the action
itself. The fruit will come of its own accord. This is a powerful spiritual practice. In
the Bhagavad Gita, one of the oldest and most beautiful spiritual teachings in
existence, non-attachment to the fruit of your action is called Karma Yoga. It is
described as the path of "consecrated action."
When the compulsive striving away from the Now ceases, the joy of Being flows into
everything you do. The moment your attention turns to the Now, you feel a presence,
a stillness, a peace. You no longer depend on the future for fulfillment and
satisfaction - you don't look to it for salvation. Therefore, you are not attached to the
results. Neither failure nor success has the power to change your inner state of Being.
You have found the life underneath your life situation.
In the absence of psychological time, your sense of self is derived from Being, not
from your personal past. Therefore, the psychological need to become anything other
than who you are already is no longer there. In the world, on the level of your life
situation, you may indeed become wealthy, knowledgeable, successful, free of this or
that, but in the deeper dimension of Being you are complete and whole now.


In that state of wholeness, would we still be able or willing to pursue external goals?
Of course, but you will not have illusory expectations that anything or anybody in the
future will save you or make you happy. As far as your life situation is concerned,
there may be things to be attained or acquired. That's the world of form, of gain and
loss. Yet on a deeper level you are already complete, and when you realize that, there
is a playful, joyous energy behind what you do. Being free of psychological time, you
no longer pursue your goals with grim determination, driven by fear, anger,
discontent, or the need to become someone. Nor will you remain inactive through
fear of failure, which to the egois loss of self. When your deeper sense of self is
derived from Being, when you are free of "becoming" as a psychological need,
neither your happiness nor your sense of self depends on the outcome, and so there is
freedom from fear. You don't seek permanency where it cannot be found: in the
world of form, of gain and loss, birth and death. You don't demand that situations,
conditions, places, or people should make you happy, and then suffer when they don't
live up to your expectations.
Everything is honored, but nothing matters. Forms are born and die, yet you are
aware of the eternal underneath the forms. You know that "nothing real can be
threatened."




                                            47

When this is your state of Being, how can you not succeed? You have succeeded
already.

4. MIND STRATEGIES FOR AVOIDING THE NOW



Loss Of Now: The Core Delusion
Even if I completely accept that ultimately time is an illusion, what difference is that
going to make in my life? I still have to live in a world that is completely dominated
by time.
Intellectual agreement is just another belief and won't make much difference to your
life. To realize this truth, you need to live it. When every cell of your body is so
present that it feels vibrant with life, and when you can feel that life every moment as
the joy of Being, then it can be said that you are free of time.


But I still have to pay the bills tomorrow, and I am still going to grow old and die just
like everybody else. So how can I ever say that I am free of time?
Tomorrow's bills are not the problem. The dissolution of the physical body is not a
problem. Loss of Now is the problem, or rather: the core delusion that turns a mere
situation, event, or emotion into a personal problem and into suffering. Loss of Now
is loss of Being.
To be free of time is to be free of the psychological need of past for your identity and
future for your fulfillment. It represents the most profound transformation of
consciousness that you can imagine. In some rare cases, this shift in consciousness
happens dramatically and radically, once and for all. When it does, it usually comes
about through total surrender in the midst of intense suffering. Most people, however,
have to work at it.
When you have had your first few glimpses of the timeless state of consciousness,
you begin to move back and 'forth between the dimensions of time and presence. First
you become aware of just how rarely your attention is truly in the Now. But to know
that you are not present is a great success: that knowing is presence - even if initially
it only lasts for a couple of seconds of clock time before it is lost again. Then, with
increasing frequency, you choose to have the focus of your consciousness in the
present moment rather than in the past or future, and whenever you realize that you
had lost the Now, you are able to stay- in it not just for a couple of seconds, but for
longer periods as perceived from the external perspective of clock time. So before
you are firmly established in the state of presence, which is to say before you are

                                             49

fully conscious, you shift back and forth for a while between consciousness and
unconsciousness, between the state of presence and the state of mind identification.
You lose the Now, and you return to it, again and again. Eventually, presence
becomes your predominant state.
For most people, presence is experienced either never at all or only accidentally and
briefly on rare occasions without being recognized for what it is. Most humans
alternate not between consciousness and unconsciousness but only between different
levels of unconsciousness.


Ordinary Unconsciousness And Deep Unconsciousness
What do you mean by different levels of unconsciousness?
As you probably know, in sleep you constantly move between the phases of
dreamless sleep and the dream state. Similarly, in wakefulness most people only shift
between ordinary unconsciousness and deep unconsciousness. What I call ordinary
unconsciousness means being identified with your thought processes and emotions,
your reactions, desires, and aversions. It is most people's normal state. In that state,
you are run by the egoic mind, and you are unaware of Being. It is a state not of acute
pain or unhappiness but of an almost continuous low level of unease, discontent,
boredom, or nervousness - a kind of background static. You may not realize this
because it is so much a part of "normal" living, just as you are not aware of a con-
tinuous low background noise, such as the hum of an air conditioner, until it stops.
When it suddenly does stop, there is a sense of relief. Many people use alcohol,
drugs, sex, food, work, television, or even shopping as anesthetics in an unconscious
attempt to remove the basic unease. When this happens, an activity that might be very
enjoyable if used in moderation becomes imbued with a compulsive or addictive
quality, and all that is ever achieved through it is extremely short-lived symptom
relief.
The unease of ordinary unconsciousness turns into the pain of deep unconsciousness -
a state of more acute and more obvious suffering or unhappiness - when things "go
wrong," when the ego is threatened or there is a major challenge, threat, or loss, real
or imagined, in your life situation or conflict in a relationship. It is an intensified
version of ordinary unconsciousness, different from it not in kind but in degree.
In ordinary unconsciousness, habitual resistance to or denial of what is creates the
unease and discontent that most people accept as normal living. When this resistance
becomes intensified through some challenge or threat to the ego, it brings up intense
negativity such as anger, acute fear, aggression, depression, and so on. Deep
unconsciousness often means that the pain-body has been triggered and that you have

                                           50

become identified with it. Physical violence would be impossible without deep
unconsciousness. It can also occur easily whenever and wherever a crowd of people
or even an entire nation generates a negative collective energy field.
The best indicator of your level of consciousness is how you deal with life's
challenges when they come. Through those challenges, an already unconscious
person tends to become more deeply unconscions, and a conscious person more
intensely conscious. You can use a challenge to awaken you, or you can allow it to
pull you into even deeper sleep. The dream of ordinary unconsciousness then turns
into a nightmare.
If you cannot be present even in normal circumstances, such as when you are sitting
alone in a room, walking in the woods, or listening to someone, then you certainly
won't be able to stay conscious when something "goes wrong" or you are faced with
difficult people or situations, with loss or the threat of loss. You will be taken over by
a reaction, which ultimately is always some form of fear, and pulled into deep
unconsciousness. Those challenges are your tests. Only the way in which you deal
with them will show you and others where you are at as far as your state of
consciousness is concerned, not how long you can sit with your eyes closed or what
visions you see.
So it is essential to bring more consciousness into your life in ordinary situations
when everything is going relatively smoothly. In this way, you grow in presence
power. It generates an energy field in you and around you of a high vibrational
frequency. No unconsciousness, no negativity, no discord or violence can enter that
field and survive, just as darkness cannot survive in the presence of light.
When you learn to be the witness of your thoughts and emotions, which is an
essential part of being present, you may be surprised when you first become aware of
the background "static" of ordinary unconsciousness and realize how rarely, if ever,
you are truly at ease within yourself. On the level of your thinking, you will find a
great deal of resistance in the form of judgment, discontent, and mental projection
away from the Now. On the emotional level, there will be an undercurrent of unease,
tension, boredom, or nervousness. Both are aspects of the mind in its habitual
resistance mode.


What Are They Seeking?
Carl Jung tells in one of his books of a conversation he had with a Native American
chief who pointed out to him that in his perception most white people have tense
faces, staring eyes, and a cruel demeanor. He said: "They are always seeking



                                             51

something. What are they seeking? The whites always want something. They are
always uneasy and restless. We don't know what they want. We think they are mad."
The undercurrent of constant unease started long before the rise of Western industrial
civilization, of course, but in Western civilization, which now covers almost the
entire globe, including most of the East, it manifests in an unprecedentedly acute
form. It was already there at the time of Jesus, and it was there 600 years before that
at the time of Buddha, and long before that. Why are you always anxious? Jesus
asked his disciples. "Can anxious thought add a single day to your life?" And the
Buddha taught that the root of suffering is to be found in our constant wanting and
craving.
Resistance to the Now as a collective dysfunction is intrinsically connected to loss of
awareness of Being and forms the basis of our dehumanized industrial civilization.
Freud, by the way, also recognized the existence of this undercurrent of unease and
wrote about it in his book Civilization and Its Discontents, but he did not recognize
the true root of the unease and failed to realize that freedom from it is possible. This
collective dysfunction has created a very unhappy and extraordinarily violent
civilization that has become a threat not only to itself but also to all life on the planet.


Dissolving Ordinary Unconsciousness
So how can we be free of this affliction?
Make it conscious. Observe the many ways in which unease, discontent, and tension
arise within you through unnecessary judgment, resistance to what is, and denial of
the Now. Anything unconscious dissolves when you shine the light of consciousness
on it. Once you know how to dissolve ordinary unconsciousness, the light of your
presence will shine brightly, and it will be much easier to deal with deep
unconsciousness whenever you feel its gravitational pull.
However, ordinary unconsciousness may not be easy to detect initially because it is
so normal.
Make it a habit to monitor your mental-emotional state through self-observation. `Am
I at ease at this moment?" is a good question to ask yourself frequently. Or you can
ask: "What's going on inside me at this moment?" Be at least as interested in what
goes on inside you as what happens outside. If you get the inside right, the outside
will fall into place. Primary reality is within, secondary reality without. But don't
answer these questions immediately. Direct your attention inward. Have a look inside
yourself. What kind of thoughts is your mind producing? What do you feel? Direct
your attention into the body. Is there any tension? Once you detect that there is a low
level of unease, the background static, see in what way you are avoiding, resisting, or

                                           52

denying life - by denying the Now. There are many ways in which people
unconsciously resist the present moment. 1 will give you a few examples. With
practice, your power of self-observation, of monitoring your inner state, will become
sharpened.


Freedom From Unhappiness
Do you resent doing what you are doing? It may be your job, or you may have agreed
to do something and are doing it, but part of you resents and resists it. Are you
carrying unspoken resentment toward a person close to you? Do you realize that the
energy you thus emanate is so harmful in its effects that you are in fact contaminating
yourself as well as those around you? Have a good look inside. Is there even the
slightest trace of resentment, unwillingness? If there is, observe it on both the mental
and the emotional levels. What thoughts is your mind creating around this situation?
Then look at the emotion, which is the body's reaction to those thoughts. Feel the
emotion. Does it feel pleasant or unpleasant? Is it an energy that you would actually
choose to have inside you? Do you have a choice?
Maybe you are being taken advantage of, maybe the activity you are engaged in is
tedious, maybe someone close to you is dishonest, irritating, or unconscious, but all
this is irrelevant. Whether your thoughts and emotions about this situation are
justified or not makes no difference. The fact is that you are resisting what is. You are
making the present moment into an enemy. You are creating unhappiness, conflict
between the inner and the outer. Your unhappiness is polluting not only your own
inner being and those around you but also the collective human psyche of which you
are an inseparable part. The pollution of the planet is only an outward reflection of an
inner psychic pollution: millions of unconscious individuals not taking responsibility
for their inner space.
Either stop doing what you are doing, speak to the person concerned and express
fully what you feel, or drop the negativity that your mind has created around the
situation and that serves no purpose whatsoever except to strengthen a false sense of
self. Recognizing its futility is important. Negativity is never the optimum way of
dealing with any situation. In fact, in most cases it keeps you stuck in it, blocking real
change. Anything that is done with negative energy will become contaminated by it
and in time give rise to more pain, more unhappiness. Furthermore, any negative
inner state is contagious: Unhappiness spreads more easily than a physical disease.
Through the law of resonance, it triggers and feeds latent negativity in others, unless
they are immune - that is, highly conscious.



                                           53

Are you polluting the world or cleaning up the mess? You are responsible for your
inner space; nobody else is, just as you are responsible for the planet. As within, so
without: If humans clear inner pollution, then they will also cease to create outer
pollution.


How can we drop negativity, as you suggest?
By dropping it. How do you drop a piece of hot coal that you are holding in your
hand? How do you drop some heavy and useless baggage that you are carrying? By
recognizing that you don't want to suffer the pain or carry the burden anymore and
then letting go of it.
Deep unconsciousness, such as the pain-body, or other deep pain, such as the loss of
a loved one, usually needs to be transmuted through acceptance combined with the
light of your presence - your sustained attention. Many patterns in ordinary
unconsciousness, on the other hand, can simply be dropped once you know that you
don't want them and don't need them anymore, once you realize that you have a
choice, that you are not just a bundle of conditioned reflexes. All this implies that you
are able to access the power of Now. Without it, you have no choice.


If you call some emotions negative, aren't you creating a mental polarity of
good and bad, as you explained earlier?
No. The polarity was created at an earlier stage when your mind judged the present
moment as bad; this judgment then created the negative emotion.


But if you call some emotions negative, aren't you really saying that they shouldn't be
there, that it's not okay to have those emotions? My understanding is that we should
give ourselves permission to have whatever feelings come up, rather than judge them
as bad or say that we shouldn't have them. It's okay to feel resentful; it's okay to be
angry, irritated, moody, or whatever - otherwise, we get into repression, inner
conflict, or denial. Everything is okay as it is.
Of course. Once a mind pattern, an emotion or a reaction is there, accept it. You were
not conscious enough to have a choice in the matter. That's not a judgment, just a
fact. If you had a choice, or realized that you do have a choice, would you choose
suffering or joy, ease or unease, peace or conflict? Would you choose a thought or
feeling that cuts you off from your natural state of well-being, the joy of life within?
Any such feeling 1 call negative, which simply means bad. Not in the sense that "You
shouldn't have done that" but just plain factual bad, like feeling sick in the stomach.


                                            54

How is it possible that humans killed in excess of 100 million fellow humans in the
twentieth century alone? Humans inflicting pain of such magnitude on one another is
beyond anything you can imagine. And that's not taking into account the mental,
emotional and physical violence, the torture, pain, and cruelty they continue to inflict
on each other as well as on other sentient beings on a daily basis.
Do they act in this way because they are in touch with their natural state, the joy of
life within? Of course not. Only people who are in a deeply negative state, who feel
very bad indeed, would create such a reality as a reflection of how they feel. Now
they are engaged in destroying nature and the planet that sustains them. Unbelievable
but true. Humans are a dangerously insane and very sick species. That's not a
judgment. Ifs a fact. It is also a fact that the sanity is there underneath the madness.
Healing and redemption are available right now.
Coming back specifically to what you said - it is certainly true that, when you accept
your resentment, moodiness, anger, and so on, you are no longer forced to act them
out blindly, and you are less likely to project them onto others. But I wonder if you
are not deceiving yourself. When you have been practicing acceptance for a while, as
you have, there comes a point when you need to go on to the next stage, where those
negative emotions are not created anymore. If you don't, your "acceptance" just
becomes a mental label that allows your ego to continue to indulge in unhappiness
and so strengthen its sense of separation from other people, your surroundings, your
here and now. As you know, separation is the basis for the ego's sense of identity.
True acceptance would transmute those feelings at once. And if you really knew
deeply that everything is "okay," as you put it, and which of course is true, then
would you have those negative feelings in the first place? Without judgment, without
resistance to what is, they would not arise. You have an idea in your mind that
"everything is okay," but deep down you don't really believe it, and so the old mental-
emotional patterns of resistance are still in place. That's what makes you feel bad.


That's okay, too.
Are you defending your right to be unconscious, your right to suffer? Don't worry:
nobody is going to take that away from you. Once you realize that a certain kind of
food makes you sick, would you carry on eating that food and keep asserting that it is
okay to be sick?


Wherever You Are, Be There Totally
Can you give some more examples of ordinary unconsciousness?


                                             55

See if you can catch yourself complaining, in either speech or thought, about a
situation you find yourself in, what other people do or say, your surroundings, your
life situation, even the weather. To complain is always non-acceptance of what is. It
invariably carries an unconscious negative charge. When you complain, you make
yourself into a victim. When you speak out, you are in your power. So change the
situation by taking action or by speaking out if necessary or possible; leave the
situation or accept it. All else is madness.
Ordinary unconsciousness is always linked in some way with denial of the Now. The
Now, of course, also implies the here. Are you resisting your here and now? Some
people would always rather be somewhere else. Their "here" is never good enough.
Through selfobservation, find out if that is the case in your life. Wherever you are, be
there totally. If you find your here and now intolerable and it makes you unhappy,
you have three options: remove yourself from the situation, change it, or accept it
totally. If you want to take responsibility for your life, you must choose one of those
three options, and you must choose now. Then accept the consequences. No excuses.
No negativity. No psychic pollution. Keep your inner space clear.
If you take any action - leaving or changing your situation - drop the negativity first,
if at all possible. Action arising out of insight into what is required is more effective
than action arising out of negativity.
Any action is often better than no action, especially if you have been stuck in an
unhappy situation for a long time. If it is a mistake, at least you learn something, in
which case it's no longer a mistake. If you remain stuck, you learn nothing. Is fear
preventing you from taking action? Acknowledge the fear, watch it, take your
attention into it, be fully present with it. Doing so cuts the link between the fear and
your thinking. Don't let the fear rise up into your mind. Use the power of the Now.
Fear cannot prevail against it.
If there is truly nothing that you can do to change your here and now, and you can't
remove yourself from the situation, then accept your here and now totally by
dropping all inner resistance. The false, unhappy self that loves feeling miserable,
resentful, or sorry for itself can then no longer survive. This is called surrender.
Surrender is not weakness. There is great strength in it. Only a surrendered person
has spiritual power. Through surrender, you will be free internally of the situation.
You may then find that the situation changes without any effort on your part. In any
case, you are free.
Or is there something that you "should" be doing but are not doing it? Get up and do
it now. Alternatively, completely accept your inactivity, laziness, or passivity at this
moment, if that is your choice. Go into it fully. Enjoy it. Be as lazy or inactive as you

                                             56

can. If you go into it fully and consciously, you will soon come out of it. Or maybe
you won't. Either way, there is no inner conflict, no resistance, no negativity.
Are you stressed? Are you so busy getting to the future that the present is reduced to
a means of getting there? Stress is caused by being "here" but wanting to be "there,"
or being in the present but wanting to be in the future. It's a split that tears you apart
inside. To create and live with such an inner split is insane. The fact that everyone
else is doing it doesn't make it any less insane. If you have to, you can move fast,
work fast, or even run, without projecting yourself into the future and without
resisting the present. As you move, work, run - do it totally. Enjoy the flow of energy,
the high energy of that moment. Now you are no longer stressed, no longer splitting
yourself in two. Just moving, running, working - and enjoying it. Or you can drop the
whole thing and sit on a park bench. But when you do, watch your mind. It may say:
"You should be working. You are wasting time." Observe the mind. Smile at it.
Does the past take up a great deal of your attention? Do you frequently talk and think
about it, either positively or negatively? The great things that you have achieved,
your adventures or experiences, or your victim story and the dreadful things that were
done to you, or maybe what you did to someone else? Are your thought processes
creating guilt, pride, resentment, anger, regret, or self-pity? Then you are not only
reinforcing a false sense of self but also helping to accelerate your body's aging
process by creating an accumulation of past in your psyche. Verify this for yourself
by observing those around you who have a strong tendency to hold on to the past.
Die to the past every moment. You don' t need it. Only refer to it when it is absolutely
relevant to the present. Feel the power of this moment and the fullness of Being. Feel
your presence.
Are you worried? Do you have many "what if" thoughts? You are identified with
your mind, which is projecting itself into an imaginary future situation and creating
fear. There is no way that you can cope with such a situation, because it doesn't exist.
It's a mental phantom. You can stop this health- and life-corroding insanity simply by
acknowledging the present moment. Become aware of your breathing. Feel the air
flowing in and out of your body. Feel your inner energy field. All that you ever have
to deal with, cope with, in real life - as opposed to imaginary mind projections ­ is
this moment. Ask yourself what "problem' you have right now, not next year,
tomorrow, or five minutes from now. What is wrong with this moment? You can
always cope with the Now, but you can never cope with the future -nor do you have
to. The answer, the strength, the right action or the resource will be there when you
need it, not before, not after.



                                           57

"One day I'll make it." Is your goal taking up so much of your attention that you
reduce the present moment to a means to an end? Is it taking the joy out of your
doing? Are you waiting to start living? If you develop such a mind pattern, no matter
what you achieve or get, the present will never be good enough; the future will
always seem better. A perfect recipe for permanent dissatisfaction and nonfulfillment,
don' t you agree?
Are you a habitual "waiter"? How much of your life do you spend waiting? What I
call "small-scale waiting" is waiting in line at the post office, in a traffic jam, at the
airport, or waiting for someone to arrive, to finish work, and so on. "Large-scale
waiting" is waiting for the next vacation, for a better job, for the children to grow up,
for a truly meaningful relationship, for success, to make money, to be important, to
become enlightened. It is not uncommon for people to spend their whole life waiting
to start living.
Waiting is a state of mind. Basically, it means that you want the future; you don't
want the present. You don't want what you've got, and you want what you haven't
got. With every kind of waiting, you unconsciously create inner conflict between
your here and now, where you don't want to be, and the projected future, where you
want to be. This greatly reduces the quality of your life by making you lose the
present.
There is nothing wrong with striving to improve your life situation. You can improve
your life situation, but you cannot improve your life. Life is primary. Life is your
deepest inner Being. It is already whole, complete, perfect. Your life situation
consists of your circumstances and your experiences. There is nothing wrong with
setting goals and striving to achieve things. The mistake lies in using it as a substitute
for the feeling of life, for Being. The only point of access for that is the Now. You are
then like an architect who pays no attention to the foundation of a building but spends
a lot of time working on the superstructure.
For example, many people are waiting for prosperity. It cannot come in the future.
When you honor, acknowledge, and fully accept your present reality - where you are,
who you are, what you are doing right now - when you fully accept what you have
got, you are grateful for what you have got, grateful for what is, grateful for Being.
Gratitude for the present moment and the fullness of life now is true prosperity. It
cannot come in the future. Then, in time, that prosperity manifests for you in various
ways.
If you are dissatisfied with what you have got, or even frustrated or angry about your
present lack, that may motivate you to become rich, but even if you do make
millions, you will continue to experience the inner condition of lack, and deep down

                                            58

you will continue to feel unfulfilled. You may have many exciting experiences that
money can buy, but they will come and go and always leave you with an empty
feeling and the need for further physical or psychological gratification. You won't
abide in Being and so feel the fullness of life now that alone is true prosperity.
So give up waiting as a state of mind. When you catch yourself slipping into waiting
... snap out of it. Come into the present moment. Just be, and enjoy being. If you are
present, there is never any need for you to wait for anything. So next time somebody
says, "Sorry to have kept you waiting," you can reply, "That's all right, I wasn't
waiting. I was just standing here enjoying myself - in joy in my self."
These are just a few of the habitual mind strategies for denying the present moment
that are part of ordinary unconsciousness. They are easy to overlook because they are
so much a part of normal living: the background static of perpetual discontent. But
the more you practice monitoring your inner mental-emotional state, the easier it will
be to know when you have been trapped in past or future, which is to say
unconscious, and to awaken out of the dream of time into the present. But beware:
The false, unhappy self, based on mind identification, lives on time. It knows that the
present moment is its own death and so feels very threatened by it. It will do all it can
to take you out of it. It will try to keep you trapped in time.


The Inner Purpose Of Your Life's Journey
I can see the truth of what you are saying, but I still think that we must have purpose
on our life's journey, otherwise we just drift, and purpose means future, doesn't it?
How do we reconcile that with living in the present?
When you are on a journey, it is certainly helpful to know where you are going or at
least the general direction in which you are moving, but don't forget: the only thing
that is ultimately real about your journey is the step that you are taking at this
moment. That's all there ever is.
Your life's journey has an outer purpose and an inner purpose. The outer purpose is to
arrive at your goal or destination, to accomplish what you set out to do, to achieve
this or that, which, of course, implies future. But if your destination, or the steps you
are going to take in the future, take up so much of your attention that they become
more important to you than the step you are taking now, then you completely miss
the journey's inner purpose, which has nothing to do with where you are going or
what you are doing, but everything to do with how. It has nothing to do with future
but everything to do with the quality of your consciousness at this moment. The outer
purpose belongs to the horizontal dimension of space and time; the inner purpose
concerns a deepening of your Being in the vertical dimension of the timeless Now.

                                             59

Your outer journey may contain a million steps; your inner journey only has one: the
step you are taking right now. As you become more deeply aware of this one step,
you realize that it already contains within itself all the other steps as well as the
destination. This one step then becomes transformed into an expression of perfection,
an act of great beauty and quality. It will have taken you into Being, and the light of
Being will shine through it. This is both the purpose and the fulfillment of your inner
journey, the journey into yourself.


Does it matter whether we achieve our outer purpose, whether we succeed or fail in
the world?
It will matter to you as long as you haven't realized your inner purpose. After that, the
outer purpose is just a game that you may continue to play simply because you enjoy
it. It is also possible to fail completely in your outer purpose and at the same time
totally succeed in your inner purpose. Or the other way around, which is actually
more common: outer riches and inner poverty, or to "gain the world and lose your
soul," as Jesus puts it. Ultimately, of course, every outer purpose is doomed to "fail"
sooner or later, simply because it is subject to the law of impermanence of all things.
The sooner you realize that your outer purpose cannot give you lasting fulfillment,
the better. When you have seen the limitations of your outer purpose, you give up
your unrealistic expectation that it should make you happy, and you make it
subservient to your inner purpose.


The Past Cannot Survive In Your Presence
You mentioned that thinking or talking about the past unnecessarily is one of the
ways in which we avoid the present. But apart from the past that we remember and
perhaps identify with, isn't there another level of past within us that is much more
deep-seated? I am talking about the unconscious past that conditions our lives,
especially through early childhood experiences, perhaps even past-life experiences.
And then there is our cultural conditioning, which has to do with where we live
geographically and the historical time period in which we live. All these things
determine how we see the world, how we react, what we think, what kind of
relationships we have, how we live our lives. How could we ever become conscious of
all that or get rid of it? How long would that take? And even if we did, what would
there be left?
What is left when illusion ends?
There is no need to investigate the unconscious past in you except as it manifests at
this moment as a thought, an emotion, a desire, a reaction, or an external event that

                                            60

happens to you. Whatever you need to know about the unconscious past in you, the
challenges of the present will bring it out. If you delve into the past, it will become a
bottomless pit: There is always more. You may think that you need more time to
understand the past or become free of it, in other words, that the future will
eventually free you of the past. This is a delusion. Only the present can free you of
the past. More time cannot free you of time. Access the power of Now. That is the
key.


What is the power of Now?
None other than the power of your presence, your consciousness liberated from
thought forms.
So deal with the past on the level of the present. The more attention you give to the
past, the more you energize it, and the more likely you are to make a "self' out of it.
Don't misunderstand: Attention is essential, but not to the past as past. Give attention
to the present; give attention to your behavior, to your reactions, moods, thoughts,
emotions, fears, and desires as they occur in the present. There's the past in you. If
you can be present enough to watch all those things, not critically or analytically but
nonjudgmentally, then you are dealing with the past and dissolving it through the
power of your presence. You cannot find yourself by going into the past. You find
yourself by coming into the present.


Isn't it helpful to understand the past and so understand why we do certain things,
react in certain ways, or why we unconsciously create our particular kind of drama,
patterns in relationships, and so on?
As you become more conscious of your present reality, you may suddenly get certain
insights as to why your conditioning functions in those particular ways; for example,
why your relationships follow certain patterns, and you may remember things that
happened in the past or see them more clearly. That is fine and can be helpful, but it
is not essential. What is essential is your conscious presence. That dissolves the past.
That is the transformative agent. So don't seek to understand the past, but be as
present as you can. The past cannot survive in your presence. It can only survive in
your absence.

5. THE STATE OF PRESENCE



It's Not What You Think It Is
You keep talking about the state of presence as the key. I think I understand it
intellectually, but I don't know if I have ever truly experienced it. I wonder - is it what
I think it is, or is it something entirely different?
It's not what you think it is! You can't think about presence, and the mind can't
understand it. Understanding presence is being present.
Try a little experiment. Close your eyes and say to yourself: "I wonder what my next
thought is going to be." Then become very alert and wait for the next thought. Be like
a cat watching a mouse hole. What thought is going to come out of the mouse hole?
Try it now.
Well?


I had to wait for quite a long time before a thought came in.
Exactly. As long as you are in a state of intense presence, you are free of thought.
You are still, yet highly alert. The instant your conscious attention sinks below a
certain level, thought rushes in. The mental noise returns; the stillness is lost. You are
back in time.
To test their degree of presence, some Zen masters have been known to creep up on
their students from behind and suddenly hit them with a stick. Quite a shock! If the
student had been fully present and in a state of alertness, if he had "kept his loin
girded and his lamp burning," which is one of the analogies that Jesus uses for
presence, he would have noticed the master coming up from behind and stopped him
or stepped aside. But if he were hit, that would mean he was immersed in thought,
which is to say absent, unconscious.
To stay present in everyday life, it helps to be deeply rooted within yourself,
otherwise, the mind, which has incredible momentum, will drag you along like a wild
river.


What do you mean by "rooted within yourself"?



                                               62

It means to inhabit your body fully. To always have some of your attention in the
inner energy field of your body. To feel the body from within, so to speak. Body
awareness keeps you present. It anchors you in the Now (see Chapter 6).


The Esoteric Meaning Of "Waiting"
In a sense, the state of presence could be compared to waiting. Jesus used the analogy
of waiting in some of his parables. This is not the usual bored or restless kind of
waiting that is a denial of the present and that I spoke about already. It is not a
waiting in which your attention is focused on some point in the future and the present
is perceived as an undesirable obstacle that prevents you from having what you want.
There is a qualitatively different kind of waiting, one that requires your total
alertness. Something could happen at any moment, and if you are not absolutely
awake, absolutely still, you will miss it. This is the kind of waiting Jesus talks about.
In that state, all your attention is in the Now. There is none left for daydreaming,
thinking, remembering, anticipating. There is no tension in it, no fear, just alert
presence. You are present with your whole Being, with every cell of your body. In
that state, the "you' that has a past and a future, the personality if you like, is hardly
there anymore. And yet nothing of value is lost. You are still essentially yourself. In
fact, you are more fully yourself than you ever were before, or rather it is only now
that you are truly yourself.
"Be like a servant waiting for the return of the master," says Jesus. The servant does
not know at what hour the master is going to come. So he stays awake, alert, poised,
still, lest he miss the master's arrival. In another parable, Jesus speaks of the five
careless (unconscious) women who do not have enough oil (consciousness) to keep
their lamps burning (stay present) and so miss the bridegroom (the Now) and don't
get to the wedding feast (enlightenment). These five stand in contrast to the five wise
women who have enough oil (stay conscious).
Even the men who wrote the Gospels did not understand the meaning of these
parables, so the first misinterpretations and distortions crept in as they were written
down. With subsequent erroneous interpretations, the real meaning was completely
lost. These are parables not about the end of the world but about the end of
psychological time. They point to the transcendence of the egoic mind and the
possibility of living in an entirely new state of consciousness.


Beauty Arises In The Stillness Of Your Presence
What you have just described is something that I occasionally experience for brief
moments when I am alone and surrounded by nature. Yes. Zen masters use the word

                                            63

satori to describe a flash of insight, a moment of no-mind and total presence.
Although satori is not a lasting transformation, be grateful when it comes, for it gives
you a taste of enlightenment. You may, indeed, have experienced it many times with-
out knowing what. it is and realizing its importance. Presence is needed to become
aware of the beauty, the majesty, the sacredness of nature. Have you ever gazed up
into the infinity of space on a clear night, Yes, but only as seen from the limited
perspective of the manifested universe. In the Bible, God declares: "I am the Alpha
and the Omega, and I am the living One." In the timeless realm where God dwells,
which is also your home, the beginning and the end, the Alpha and the Omega, are
one, and the essence of everything that ever has been and ever will be is eternally
present in an unmanifested state of oneness and perfection - totally beyond anything
the human mind can ever imagine or comprehend. In our world of seemingly separate
forms, however, timeless perfection is an inconceivable concept. Here even
consciousness, which is the light emanating from the eternal Source, seems to be
subject to a process of development, but this is due to our limited perception. It is not
so in absolute terms. Nevertheless, let me continue to speak for a moment about the
evolution of consciousness in this world.
Everything that exists has Being, has God-essence, has some degree of
consciousness. Even a stone has rudimentary consciousness; otherwise, it would not
be, and its atoms and molecules would disperse. Everything is alive. The sun, the
earth, plants, animals, humans - all are expressions of consciousness in varying
degrees, consciousness manifesting as form.
The world arises when consciousness takes on shapes and forms, thought forms and
material forms. Look at the millions of life forms on this planet alone. In the sea, on
land, in the air - and then each life form is replicated millions of times. To what end?
Is someone or something playing a game, a game with form? This is what the ancient
seers of India asked themselves. They saw the world as lila, a kind of divine game
that God is playing. The individual life forms are obviously not very important in this
game. In the sea, most life forms don't survive for more than a few minutes after
being born. The human form turns to dust pretty quickly too, and when it is gone it is
as if it had never been. Is that tragic or cruel? Only if you create a separate identity
for each form, if you forget that its consciousness is God-essence expressing itself in
form. But you don't truly know that until you realize your own God-essence as pure
consciousness.
Awestruck by the absolute stillness and inconceivable vastness of' it? Have you
listened, truly listened, to the sound of a mountain stream in the forest? Or to the song
of a blackbird at dusk on a quiet summer evening? To become aware of such things,


                                            64

the mind needs to be still. You have to put down for a moment your personal baggage
of problems, of past and future, as well as all your knowledge; otherwise, you will
see but not see, hear but not hear. Your total presence is required.
Beyond the beauty of the external forms, there is more here: something that cannot be
named, something ineffable, some deep, inner, holy essence. Whenever and wherever
there is beauty, this inner essence shines through somehow. It only reveals itself to
you when you are present. Could it be that this nameless essence and your presence
are one and the same? Would it be there without your presence? Go deeply into it.
Find out for yourself.
When you experienced those moments of presence, you likely didn't realize that you
were briefly in a state of no-mind. This is because the gap between that state and the
influx of thought was too narrow. Your satori may only have lasted for a few seconds
before the mind came in, but it was there; otherwise, you would not have experienced
the beauty. Mind can neither recognize nor create beauty. Only for a few seconds,
while you were completely present, was that beauty or that sacredness there. Because
of the narrowness of that gap and a lack of vigilance and alertness on your part, you
were probably unable to see the fundamental difference between the perception, the
thought-less awareness of beauty, and the naming and interpreting of it as thought:
The time gap was so small that it seemed to be a single process. The truth is,
however, that the moment thought came in, all you had was a memory of it.
The wider the time gap between perception and thought, the more depth there is to
you as a human being, which is to say the more conscious you are.
Many people are so imprisoned in their minds that the beauty of nature does not
really exist for them. They might say, "What a pretty flower," but that's just a
mechanical mental labeling. Because they are not still, not present, they don't truly
see the flower, don't feel its essence, its holiness - just as they don't know themselves,
don't feel their own essence, their own holiness.
Because we live in such a mind-dominated culture, most modern art, architecture,
music, and literature are devoid of beauty, of inner essence, with very few exceptions.
The reason is that the people who create those things cannot - even for a moment -
free themselves from their mind. So they are never in touch with that place within
where true creativity and beauty arise. The mind left to itself creates monstrosities,
and not only in art galleries. Look at our urban landscapes and industrial wastelands.
No civilization has ever produced so much ugliness.


Realizing Pure Consciousness
Is presence the same as Being?

                                             65

When you become conscious of Being, what is really happening is that Being
becomes conscious of itself. When Being becomes conscious of itself - that's
presence. Since Being, consciousness, and life are synonymous, we could say that
presence means consciousness becoming conscious of itself, or life attaining self-
consciousness. But don't get attached to the words, and don't make an effort to
understand this. There is nothing that you need to understand before you can become
present.


I do understand what you just said, but it seems to imply that Being, the ultimate
transcendental reality, is not yet complete, that it is undergoing a process of
development. Does God need time for personal growth?
If a fish is born in your aquarium and you call it John, write out a birth certificate, tell
him about his family history, and two minutes later he gets eaten by another fish -
that's tragic. But it's only tragic because you projected a separate self where there was
none. You got hold of a fraction of a dynamic process, a molecular dance, and made a
separate entity out of it.
Consciousness takes on the disguise of forms until they reach such complexity that it
completely loses itself in them. In present-day humans, consciousness is completely
identified with its disguise. It only knows itself as form and therefore lives in fear of
the annihilation of its physical or psychological form. This is the egoic mind, and this
is where considerable dysfunction sets in. It now looks as if something had gone very
wrong somewhere along the line of evolution. But even this is part of lila, the divine
game. Finally, the pressure of suffering created by this apparent dysfunction forces
consciousness to disidentify from form and awakens it from its dream of form: It
regains self-consciousness, but it is at a far deeper level than when it lost it.
This process is explained by Jesus in his parable of the lost son, who leaves his
father's home, squanders his wealth, becomes destitute, and is then forced by his
suffering to return home. When he does, his father loves him more than before. The
sons state is the same as it was before, yet not the same. It has an added dimension of
depth. The parable describes a journey from unconscious perfection, through apparent
imperfection and "evil" to conscious perfection.
Can you now see the deeper and wider significance of becoming present as the
watcher of your mind? Whenever you watch the mind, you withdraw consciousness
from mind forms, which then becomes what we call the watcher or the witness.
Consequently, the watcher - pure consciousness beyond form - becomes stronger, and
the mental formations become weaker. When we talk about watching the mind we are
personalizing an event that is truly of cosmic significance: through you,

                                             66

consciousness is awakening out of its dream of identification with form and
withdrawing from form. This foreshadows, but is already part of, an event that is
probably still in the distant future as far as chronological time is concerned. The event
is called - the end of the world.
When consciousness frees itself from its identification with physical and mental
forms, it becomes what we may call pure or enlightened consciousness, or presence.
This has already happened in a few individuals, and it seems destined to happen soon
on a much larger scale, although there is no absolute guarantee that it will happen.
Most humans are still in the grip of the egoic mode of consciousness: identified with
their mind and run by their mind. If they do not free themselves from their mind in
time, they will be destroyed by it. They will experience increasing confusion,
conflict, violence, illness, despair, madness. Egoic mind has become like a sinking
ship. If you don't get off, you will go down with it. The collective egoic mind is the
most dangerously insane and destructive entity ever to inhabit this planet. What do
you think will happen on this planet if human consciousness remains unchanged?
Already for most humans, the only respite they find from their own minds is to
occasionally revert to a level of consciousness below thought. Everyone does that
every night during sleep. But this also happens to some extent through sex, alcohol,
and other drugs that suppress excessive mind activity. If it weren't for alcohol,
tranquilizers, antidepressants, as well as the illegal drugs, which are all consumed in
vast quantities, the insanity of the human mind would become even more glaringly
obvious than it is already. I believe that, if deprived of their drugs, a large part of the
population would become a danger to themselves and others. These drugs, of course,
simply keep you stuck in dysfunction. Their widespread use only delays the
breakdown of the old mind structures and the emergence of higher consciousness.
While individual users may get some relief from the daily torture inflicted on them by
their minds, they are prevented from generating enough conscious presence to rise
above thought and so find true liberation.
Falling back to a level of consciousness below mind, which is the pre-thinking level
of our distant ancestors and of animals and plants, is not an option for us. There is no
way back. If the human race is to survive, it will have to go on to the next stage.
Consciousness is evolving throughout the universe in billions of forms. So even if we
didn't make it, this wouldn't matter on a cosmic scale. No gain in consciousness is
ever lost, so it would simply express itself through some other form. But the very fact
that I am speaking here and you are listening or reading this is a clear sign that the
new consciousness is gaining a foothold on the planet.



                                             67

There is nothing personal in this: I am not teaching you. You are consciousness, and
you are listening to yourself. There is an Eastern saying: "The teacher and the taught
together create the teaching." In any case, the words in themselves are not important.
They are not the Truth; they only point to it. I speak from presence, and as I speak,
you may be able to join me in that state. Although every word that I use has a history,
of course, and comes from the past, as all language does, the words that I speak to
you now are carriers of the high-energy frequency of presence, quite apart from the
meaning they convey as words.
Silence is an even more potent carrier of presence, so when you read this or listen to
me speak, be aware of the silence between and underneath the words. Be aware of the
gaps. To listen to the silence, wherever you are, is an easy and direct way of
becoming present. Even if there is noise, there is always some silence underneath and
in between the sounds. Listening to the silence immediately creates stillness inside
you. Only the stillness in you can perceive the silence outside. And what is stillness
other than presence, consciousness freed from thought forms? Here is the living
realization of what we have been talking about.


Christ: The Reality Of Your Divine Presence
Don't get attached to any one word. You can substitute "Christ" for presence, if that is
more meaningful to you. Christ is your God essence or the Self, as it is sometimes
called in the East. The only difference between Christ and presence is that Christ
refers to your indwelling divinity regardless of whether you are conscious of it or not,
whereas presence means your awakened divinity or God-essence.
Many misunderstandings and false beliefs about Christ will clear if you realize that
there is no past or future in Christ. To say that Christ was or will be is a contradiction
in terms. Jesus was. He was a man who lived two thousand years ago and realized
divine presence, his true nature. And so he said: "Before Abraham was, I am." He did
not say: "I already existed before Abraham was born." That would have meant that he
was still within. the dimension of time and form identity. The words Iam used in a
sentence that starts in the past tense indicate a radical shift, a discontinuity in the
temporal dimension. It is a Zen-like statement of great profundity. Jesus attempted to
convey directly, not through discursive thought, the meaning of presence, of self
realization. He had gone beyond the consciousness dimension governed by time, into
the realm of the timeless. The dimension of eternity had come into this world.
Eternity, of course, does not mean endless time, but no time. Thus, the man Jesus
became Christ, a vehicle for pure consciousness. And what is God's self-definition in
the Bible? Did God say "I have always been, and I always will be?" Of course not.


                                            68

That would have given reality to past and future. God said: "I AM THAT I AM." No
time here, just presence.
The "second coming" of Christ is a transformation of human consciousness, a shift
from time to presence, from thinking to pure consciousness, not the arrival of some
man or woman. If "Christ" were to return tomorrow in some externalized form, what
could he or she possibly say to you other than this: "I am the Truth. I am divine
presence. I am eternal life. I am within you. I am here. I am Now."
Never personalize Christ. Don't make Christ into a form identity. Avatars, divine
mothers, enlightened masters, the very few that are real, are not special as persons.
Without a false self to uphold, defend, and feed, they are more simple, more ordinary
than the ordinary man or woman. Anyone with a strong ego would regard them as
insignificant or, more likely, not see them at all.
If you are drawn to an enlightened teacher, it is because there is already enough
presence in you to recognize presence in another. There were many people who did
not recognize Jesus or the Buddha, as there are and always have been many people
who are drawn to false teachers. Egos are drawn to bigger egos. Darkness cannot rec-
ognize light. Only light can recognize light. So don't believe that the light is outside
you or that it can only come through one particular form. If only your master is an
incarnation of God, then who are you? Any kind of exclusivity is identification with
form, and identification with form means ego, no matter how well disguised.
Use the master's presence to reflect your own identity beyond name and form back to
you and to become more intensely present yourself. You will soon realize that there is
no "mine" or "yours" in presence. Presence is one.
Group work can also be helpful for intensifying the light of your presence. A group
of people coming together in a state of presence generates a collective energy field of
great intensity. It not only raises the degree of presence of each member of the group
but also helps to free the collective human consciousness from its current state
ofmind dominance. This will make the state of presence increasingly more accessible
to individuals. However, unless at least one member of the group is already firmly
established in it and thus can hold the energy frequency of that state, the egoic mind
can easily reassert itself and sabotage the group's endeavors. Although group work is
invaluable, it is not enough, and you must not come to depend on it. Nor must you
come to depend on a teacher or a master, except during the transitional period, when
you are learning the meaning and practice of presence.

6. THE INNER BODY



Being Is Your Deepest Self
You spoke earlier about the importance of having deep roots within or inhabiting the
body. Can you explain what you meant by that?
The body can become a point of access into the realm of Being. Let's go into that
more deeply now.
I am still not quite sure if I fully understand what you mean by Being.
"Water? What do you mean by that? I don't understand it." This is what a fish would
say if it had a human mind.
Please stop trying to understand Being. You have already had significant glimpses of
Being, but the mind will always try to squeeze it into a little box and then put a label
on it. It cannot be done. It cannot become an object of knowledge. In Being, subject
and object merge into one.
Being can be felt as the ever-present I am that is beyond name and form. To feel and
thus to know that you are and to abide in that deeply rooted state is enlightenment, is
the truth that Jesus says will make you free.


Free from what?
Free from the illusion that you are nothing more than your physical body and your
mind. This "illusion of the self," as the Buddha calls it, is the core error. Free from
fear in its countless disguises as the inevitable consequence of that illusion - the fear
that is your constant tormentor as long as you derive your sense of self only from this
ephemeral and vulnerable form. And free from sin, which is the suffering you
unconsciously inflict on yourself and others as long as this illusory sense of self
governs what you think, say, and do.


Look Beyond The Words
I don't like the words in. It implies that I am being judged and found guilty.
I can understand that. Over the centuries, many erroneous views and interpretations
have accumulated around words such as sin, due to ignorance, misunderstanding, or a
desire to control, but they contain an essential core of truth. If you are unable to look


                                              70

beyond such interpretations and so cannot recognize the reality to which the word
points, then don't use it. Don't get stuck on the level of words. A word is no more
than a means to an end. Ifs an abstraction. Not unlike a signpost, it points beyond
itself. The word honey isn't honey. You can study and talk about honey for as long as
you like, but you won' t really know it until you taste it. After you have tasted it, the
word becomes less important to you. You won't be attached to it anymore. Similarly,
you can talk or think about God continuously for the rest of your life, but does that
mean you know or have even glimpsed the reality to which the word points? It really
is no more than an obsessive attachment to a signpost, a mental idol.
The reverse also applies: If, for whatever reason, you disliked the word honey, that
might prevent you from ever tasting it. If you had a strong aversion to the word God,
which is a negative form of attachment, you may be denying not just the word but
also the reality to which it points. You would be cutting yourself off from the
possibility of experiencing that reality. All this is, of course, intrinsically connected
with being identified with your mind.
So, if a word doesn't work for you anymore, then drop it and replace it with one that
does work. If you don't like the word sin, then call it unconsciousness or insanity.
That may get you closer to the truth, the reality behind the word, than a long-misused
word like sin, and leaves little room for guilt.


I don't like those words either. They imply that there is something wrong with me. I
am being judged.
Of course there is something wrong with you - and you are not being judged.
I don't mean to offend you personally, but do you not belong to the human race that
has killed over 100 million members of their own species in the twentieth century
alone?


You mean guilt by association?
It is not a question of guilt. But as long as you are run by the egoic mind, you are part
of the collective insanity. Perhaps you haven't looked very deeply into the human
condition in its state of dominance by the egoic mind. Open your eyes and see the
fear, the despair, the greed, and the violence that are all-pervasive. See the heinous
cruelty and suffering on an unimaginable scale that humans have inflicted and
continue to inflict on each other as well as on other life forms on the planet. You
don't need to condemn. Just observe. That is sin. That is insanity. That is




                                             71

unconsciousness. Above all, don't forget to observe your own mind. Seek out the root
of the insanity there.


Finding Your Invisible And Indestructible Reality
You said that identification with our physical form is part of the illusion, so how can
the body, the physical form, bring you to a realization of Being?
The body that you can see and touch cannot take you into Being. But that visible and
tangible body is only an outer shell, or rather a limited and distorted perception of a
deeper reality. In your natural state of connectedness with Being, this deeper reality
can be felt every moment as the invisible inner body, the animating presence within
you. So to "inhabit the body' is to feel the body from within, to feel the life inside the
body and thereby come to know that you are beyond the outer form.
But that is only the beginning of an inward journey that will take you ever more
deeply into a realm of great stillness and peace, yet also of great power and vibrant
life. At first, you may only get fleeting glimpses of it, but through them you will
begin to realize that you are not just a meaningless fragment in an alien universe,
briefly suspended between birth and death, allowed a few short-lived pleasures
followed by pain and ultimate annihilation. Underneath your outer form, you are
connected with something so vast, so immeasurable and sacred, that it cannot be
conceived or spoken of - yet I am speaking of it now. I am speaking of it not to give
you something to believe in but to show you how you can know it for yourself.
You are cut off from Being as long as your mind takes up all your attention. When
this happens - and it happens continuously for most people - you are not in your
body. The mind absorbs all your consciousness and transforms it into mind stuff. You
cannot stop thinking. Compulsive thinking has become a collective disease. Your
whole sense of who you are is then derived from mind activity. Your identity, as it is
no longer rooted in Being, becomes a vulnerable and ever-needy mental construct,
which creates fear as the predominant underlying emotion. The one thing that truly
matters is then missing from your life: awareness of your deeper self - your invisible
and indestructible reality.
To become conscious of Being, you need to reclaim consciousness from the mind.
This is one of the most essential tasks on your spiritual journey. It will free vast
amounts of consciousness that previously had been trapped in useless and compulsive
thinking. A very effective way of doing this is simply to take the focus of your atten-
tion away from thinking and direct it into the body, where Being can be felt in the
first instance as the invisible energy field that gives life to what you perceive as the
physical body.

                                            72

Connecting With The Inner Body
Please try it now. You may find it helpful to close your eyes for this practice. Later
on, when "being in the body' has become natural and easy, this will no longer be
necessary. Direct your attention into the body. Feel it from within. Is it alive? Is there
life in your hands, arms, legs, and feet - in your abdomen, your chest? Can you feel
the subtle energy field that pervades the entire body and gives vibrant life to every
organ and every cell? Can you feel it simultaneously in all parts of the body as a
single field of energy? Keep focusing on the feeling of your inner body for a few
moments. Do not start to think about it. Feel it. The more attention you give it, the
clearer and stronger this feeling will become. It will feel as if every cell is becoming
more alive, and if you have a strong visual sense, you may get an image of your body
becoming luminous. Although such an image can help you temporarily, pay more
attention to the feeling than to any image that may arise. An image, no matter how
beautiful or powerful, is already defined in form, so there is less scope for penetrating
more deeply.
The feeling of your inner body is formless, limitless, and unfathomable. You can
always go into it more deeply. If you cannot feel very much at this stage, pay
attention to whatever you can feel. Perhaps there is just a slight tingling in your hands
or feet. That's good enough for the moment. Just focus on the feeling. Your body is
coming alive. Later, we will practice some more. Please open your eyes now, but
keep some attention in the inner energy field of the body even as you look around the
room. The inner body lies at the threshold between your form identity and your
essence identity, your true nature. Never lose touch with it.


Transformation Through The Body
Why have most religions condemned or denied the body? It seems that spiritual
seekers have always regarded the body as a hindrance or even as sinful.
Why have so few seekers become finders?
On the level of the body, humans are very close to animals. All the basic bodily
functions - pleasure, pain, breathing, eating, drinking, defecating, sleeping, the drive
to find a mate and procreate, and of course birth and death - we share with the
animals. A long time after their fall from a state of grace and oneness into illusion,
humans suddenly woke up in what seemed to be an animal body - and they found this
very disturbing. "Don't fool yourself. You are no more than an animal." This seemed
to be the truth that was staring them in the face. But it was too disturbing a truth to
tolerate. Adam and Eve saw that they were naked, and they became afraid.
Unconscious denial of their animal nature set in very quickly. The threat that they

                                           73

might be taken over by powerful instinctual drives and revert back to complete
unconsciousness was indeed a very real one. Shame and taboos appeared around
certain parts of the body and bodily functions, especially sexuality. The light of their
consciousness was not yet strong enough to make friends with their animal nature, to
allow it to be and even enjoy that aspect of themselves - let alone to go deeply into it
to find the divine hidden within it, the reality within the illusion. So they did what
they had to do. They began to disassociate from their body. They now saw
themselves as having a body, rather than just being it.
When religions arose, this disassociation became even more pronounced as the "you
are not your body' belief. Countless people in East and West throughout the ages have
tried to find God, salvation, or enlightenment through denial of the body. This took
the form of denial of sense pleasures and of sexuality in particular, fasting, and other
ascetic practices. They even inflicted pain on the body in an attempt to weaken or
punish it because they regarded it as sinful. In Christianity, this used to be called
mortification of the flesh. Others tried to escape from the body by entering trance
states or seeking outof-the-body experiences. Many still do. Even the Buddha is said
to have practiced body denial through fasting and extreme forms of asceticism for six
years, but he did not attain enlightenment until after he had given up this practice.
The fact is that no one has ever become enlightened through denying or fighting the
body or through an out-of-the-body experience. Although such an experience can be
fascinating and can give you a glimpse of the state of liberation from the material
form, in the end you will always have to return to the body, where the essential work
of transformation takes place. Transformation is through the body, not away from it.
This is why no true master has ever advocated fighting or leaving the body, although
their mind-based followers often have.
Of the ancient teachings concerning the body, only certain fragments survive, such as
Jesus' statement that "your whole body will be filled with light," or they survive as
myths, such as the belief that Jesus never relinquished his body but remained one
with it and ascended into "heaven" with it. Almost no one to this day has understood
those fragments or the hidden meaning of certain myths, and the "you are not your
body' belief has prevailed universally, leading to body denial and attempts to escape
from the body. Countless seekers have thus been prevented from attaining spiritual
realization for themselves and becoming finders.


Is it possible to recover the lost teachings on the significance of the body or to
reconstruct them from the existing fragments?



                                           74

There is no need for that. All spiritual teachings originate from the same Source. In
that sense, there is and always has been only one master, who manifests in many
different forms. I am that master, and so are you, once you are able to access the
Source within. And the way to it is through the inner body. Although all spiritual
teachings originate from the same Source, once they become verbalized and written
down they are obviously no more than collections of words - and a word is nothing
but a signpost, as we talked about earlier. All such teachings are signposts pointing
the way back to the Source.
I have already spoken of the Truth that is hidden within your body, but I will
summarize for you again the lost teachings of the masters - so here is another
signpost. Please endeavor to feel your inner body as you read or listen.


Sermon On The Body
What you perceive as a dense physical structure called the body, which is subject to
disease, old age, and death, is not ultimately real - is not you. It is a misperception of
your essential reality that is beyond birth and death, and is due to the limitations of
your mind, which, having lost touch with Being, creates the body as evidence of its
illusory belief in separation and to justify its state of fear. But do not turn away from
the body, for within that symbol of impermanence, limitation, and death that you
perceive as the illusory creation of your mind is concealed the splendor of your
essential and immortal reality. Do not turn your attention elsewhere in your search for
the Truth, for it is nowhere else to be found but within your body.
Do not fight against the body, for in doing so you are fighting against your own
reality. You are your body. The body that you can see and touch is only a thin
illusory veil. Underneath it lies the invisible inner body, the doorway into Being, into
Life Unmanifested. Through the inner body, you are inseparably connected to this
unmanifested One Life - birthless, deathless, eternally present. Through the inner
body, you are forever one with God.


Have Deep Roots Within
The key is to be in a state of permanent connectedness with your inner body - to feel
it at all times. This will rapidly deepen and transform your life. The more
consciousness you direct into the inner body, the higher its vibrational frequency
becomes, much like a light that grows brighter as you turn up the dimmer switch and
so increase the flow of electricity. At this higher energy level, negativity cannot affect
you anymore, and you tend to attract new circumstances that reflect this higher
frequency.

                                             75

If you keep your attention in the body as much as possible, you will be anchored in
the Now. You won't lose yourself in the external world, and you won' t lose yourself
in your mind. Thoughts and emotions, fears and desires, may still be there to some
extent, but they won't take you over.
Please examine where your attention is at this moment. You are listening to me, or
you are reading these words in a book. That is the focus of your attention. You are
also peripherally aware of your surroundings, other people, and so on. Furthermore,
there may be some mind activity around what you are hearing or reading, some
mental commentary. Yet there is no need for any of this to absorb all your attention.
See if you can be in touch with your inner body at the same time. Keep some of your
attention within. Don' t let it all flow out. Feel your whole body from within, as a
single field of energy. It is almost as if you were listening or reading with your whole
body. Let this be your practice in the days and weeks to come.
Do not give all your attention away to the mind and the external world. By all means
focus on what you are doing, but feel the inner body at the same time whenever
possible. Stay rooted within. Then observe how this changes your state of
consciousness and the quality of what you are doing.
Whenever you are waiting, wherever it may be, use that time to feel the inner body.
In this way, traffic jams and line-ups become very enjoyable. Instead of mentally
projecting yourself away from the Now, go more deeply into the Now by going more
deeply into the body.
The art of inner-body awareness will develop into a completely new way of living, a
state of permanent connectedness with Being, and will add a depth to your life that
you have never known before.
It is easy to stay present as the observer of your mind when you are deeply rooted
within your body. No matter what happens on the outside, nothing can shake you
anymore.
Unless you stay present - and inhabiting your body is always an essential aspect of it
- you will continue to be run by your mind. The script in your head that you learned a
long time ago, the conditioning of your mind, will dictate your thinking and your
behavior. You may be free of it for brief intervals, but rarely for long. This is
especially true when something "goes wrong" or there is some loss or upset. Your
conditioned reaction will then be involuntary, automatic, and predictable, fueled by
the one basic emotion that underlies the mind identified state of consciousness: fear.
So when such challenges come, as they always do, make it a habit to go within at
once and focus as much as you can on the inner energy field of your body. This need


                                             76

not take long, just a few seconds. But you need to do it the moment that the challenge
presents itself. Any delay will allow a conditioned mental-emotional reaction to arise
and take you over. When you focus within and feel the inner body, you immediately
become still and present as you are withdrawing consciousness from the mind. If a
response is required in that situation, it will come up from this deeper level. Just as
the sun is infinitely brighter than a candle flame, there is infinitely more intelligence
in Being than in your mind. As long as you are in conscious contact with your inner
body, you are like a tree that is deeply rooted in the earth, or a building with a deep
and solid foundation. The latter analogy is used by Jesus in the generally
misunderstood parable of the two men who build a house. One man builds it on the
sand, without a foundation, and when the storms and floods come, the house is swept
away. The other man digs deep until he reaches the rock, then builds his house, which
is not swept away by the floods.


Before You Enter The Body, Forgive
I felt very uncomfortable when I tried to put my attention on the inner body. There
was a feeling of agitation and some nausea. So I haven't been able to experience what
you are talking about.
What you felt was a lingering emotion that you were probably unaware of, until you
started putting some attention into the body. Unless you first give it some attention,
the emotion will prevent you from gaining access to the inner body, which ties at a
deeper level underneath it. Attention does not mean that you start thinking about it. It
means to just observe the emotion, to feel it fully, and so to acknowledge and accept
it as it is. Some emotions are easily identified: anger, fear, grief, and so on. Others
may be much harder to label. They may just be vague feelings of unease, heaviness,
or constriction, halfway between an emotion and a physical sensation. In any case,
what matters is not whether you can attach a mental label to it but whether you can
bring the feeling of it into awareness as much as possible. Attention is the key to
transformation - and full attention also implies acceptance. Attention is like a beam of
light - the focused power of your consciousness that transmutes everything into itself.
In a fully functional organism, an emotion has a very short life span. It is like a
momentary ripple or wave on the surface of your Being. When you are not in your
body, however, an emotion can survive inside you for days or weeks, or join with
other emotions of a similar frequency that have merged and become the pain-body, a
parasite that can live inside you for years, feed on your energy, lead to physical
illness, and make your life miserable (see Chapter a).



                                           77

So place your attention on feeling the emotion, and check whether your mind is
holding on to a grievance pattern such as blame, self-pity, or resentment that is
feeding the emotion. If that is the case, it means that you haven't forgiven. Non-
forgiveness is often toward another person or yourself, but it may just as well be
toward any situation or condition - past, present or future - that your mind refuses to
accept. Yes, there can be non-forgiveness even with regard to the future. This is the
mind's refusal to accept uncertainty, to accept that the future is ultimately beyond its
control. Forgiveness is to relinquish your grievance and so to let go of grief. It
happens naturally once you realize that your grievance serves no purpose except to
strengthen a false sense of self. Forgiveness is to offer no resistance to life - to allow
life to live through you. The alternatives are pain and suffering, a greatly restricted
flow of life energy, and in many cases physical disease.
The moment you truly forgive, you have reclaimed your power from the mind. Non-
forgiveness is the very nature of the mind, just as the mind-made false self, the ego,
cannot survive without strife and conflict. The mind cannot forgive. Only you can.
You become present, you enter your body, you feel the vibrant peace and stillness
that emanate from Being. That is why Jesus said: "Before you enter the temple,
forgive."


Your Link With The Unmanifested
What is the relationship between presence and the inner body?
Presence is pure consciousness - consciousness that has been reclaimed from the
mind, from the world of form. The inner body is your link with the Unmanifested,
and in its deepest aspect is the Unmanifested: the Source from which consciousness
emanates as light emanates from the sun. Awareness of the inner body is con-
sciousness remembering its origin and returning to the Source.


Is the Unmanifested the same as Being?
Yes. The word Unmanifested attempts, by way of negation, to express That which
cannot be spoken, thought or imagined. It points to what it is by saying what it is not.
Being, on the other hand, is a positive term. Please don't get attached to either of these
words or start believing in them. They are no more than signposts.


You said that presence is consciousness that has been reclaimed from the mind. Who
does the reclaiming?




                                           78

You do. But since in your essence you are consciousness, we might as well say that it
is an awakening of consciousness from the dream of form. This does not mean that
your own form will instantly vanish in an explosion of light. You can continue in
your present form yet be aware of the formless and deathless deep within you.


I must admit that this is way beyond my comprehension, and yet on some deeper level
I seem to know what you are talking about. It's more like a feeling than anything else.
Am I deceiving myself?
No, you are not. Feeling will get you closer to the truth of who you are than thinking.
I cannot tell you anything that deep within you don't already know. When you have
reached a certain stage of inner connectedness, you recognize the truth when you hear
it. If you haven't reached that stage yet, the practice of body awareness will bring
about the deepening that is necessary.


Slowing Down The Aging Process
In the meantime, awareness of the inner body has other benefits in the physical realm.
One of them is a significant slowing down of the aging of the physical body.
Whereas the outer body normally appears to grow old and wither fairly quickly, the
inner body does not change with time, except that you may feel it more deeply and
become it more fully. If you are twenty years old now, the energy field of your inner
body will feel just the same when you are eighty. It will be just as vibrantly alive. As
soon as your habitual state changes from being out-of-the-body and trapped in your
mind to being in-the-body and present in the Now, your physical body will feel
lighter, clearer, more alive. As there is more consciousness in the body, its molecular
structure actually becomes less dense. More consciousness means a lessening of the
illusion of materiality.
When you become identified more with the timeless inner body than with the outer
body, when presence becomes your normal mode of consciousness and past and
future no longer dominate your attention, you do not accumulate time anymore in
your psyche and in the cells of the body. The accumulation of time as the
psychological burden of past and future greatly impairs the cells' capacity for self
renewal. So if you inhabit the inner body, the outer body will grow old at a much
slower rate, and even when it does, your timeless essence will shine through the outer
form, and you will not give the appearance of an old person.


Is there any scientific evidence for this?


                                           79

Try it out and you will be the evidence.


Strengthening The Immune System
Another benefit of this practice in the physical realm is a great strengthening of the
immune system which occurs when you inhabit the body. The more consciousness
you bring into the body, the stronger the immune system becomes. It is as if every
cell awakens and rejoices. The body loves your attention. It is also a potent form of
self healing. Most illnesses creep in when you are not present in the body. If the
master is not present in the house, all kinds of shady characters will take up residence
there. When you inhabit your body, it will be hard for unwanted guests to enter.
It is not only your physical immune system that becomes strengthened; your psychic
immune system is greatly enhanced as well. The latter protects you from the negative
mental-emotional force fields of others, which are highly contagious. Inhabiting the
body protects you not by putting up a shield, but by raising the frequency vibration of
your total energy field, so that anything that vibrates at a lower frequency, such as
fear, anger, depression, and so on, now exists in what is virtually a different order of
reality. It doesn't enter your field of consciousness anymore, or if it does you don't
need to offer any resistance to it because it passes right through you. Please don't just
accept or reject what I am saying. Put it to the test.
There is a simple but powerful self-healing meditation that you can do whenever you
feel the need to boost your immune system. It is particularly effective if used when
you feel the first symptoms of an illness, but it also works with illnesses that are
already entrenched if you use it at frequent intervals and with an intense focus. It will
also counteract any disruption of your energy field by some form of negativity.
However, it is not a substitute for the moment-to-moment practice of being in the
body, otherwise, its effect will only be temporary. Here it is.
When you are unoccupied for a few minutes, and especially last thing at night before
falling asleep and first thing in the morning before getting up, "flood" your body with
consciousness. Close your eyes. Lie flat on your back. Choose different parts of your
body to focus your attention on briefly at first: hands, feet, arms, legs, abdomen,
chest, head, and so on. Feel the life energy inside those parts as intensely as you can.
Stay with each part for fifteen seconds or so. Then let your attention run through the
body like a wave a few times, from feet to head and back again. This need only take a
minute or so. After that, feel the inner body in its totality, as a single field of energy.
Hold that feeling for a few minutes. Be intensely present during that time, present in
every cell of your body. Don't be concerned if the mind occasionally succeeds in



                                            80

drawing your attention out of the body and you lose yourself in some thought. As
soon as you notice that this has happened, just return your attention to the inner body.


Let The Breath Take You Into The Body
At times, when my mind has been very active, it has acquired such momentum that
Ifnd it impossible to take my attention away from it and feel the inner
body. This happens particularly when I get into a worry or anxiety pattern.
Do you have any suggestions?
If at any time you are finding it hard to get in touch with the inner body, it is usually
easier to focus on your breathing first. Conscious breathing, which is a powerful
meditation in its own right, will gradually put you in touch with the body. Follow the
breath with your attention as it moves in and out of your body. Breathe into the body,
and feel your abdomen expanding and contracting slightly with each inhalation and
exhalation. If you find it easy to visualize, close your eyes and see yourself
surrounded by light or immersed in a luminous substance - a sea of consciousness.
Then breathe in that light. Feel that luminous substance filling up your body and
malting it luminous also. Then gradually focus more on the feeling. You are now in
your body. Don't get attached to any visual image.


Creative Use Of Mind
If you need to use your mind for a specific purpose, use it in conjunction with your
inner body. Only if you are able to be conscious without thought can you use your
mind creatively, and the easiest way to enter that state is through your body.
Whenever an answer, a solution, or a creative idea is needed, stop thinking for a
moment by focusing attention on your inner energy field. Become aware of the
stillness. When you resume thinking, it will be fresh and creative. In any thought
activity, make it a habit to go back and forth every few minutes or so between
thinking and an inner kind of listening, an inner stillness. We could say: don't just
think with your head, think with your whole body.


The Art Of Listening
When listening to another person, don't just listen with your mind, listen with your
whole body. Feel the energy field of your inner body as you listen. That takes
attention away from thinking and creates a still space that enables you to truly listen
without the mind interfering. You are giving the other person space - space to be. It is
the most precious gift you can give. Most people don't know how to listen because
the major part of their attention is taken up by thinking. They pay more attention to

                                           81

that than to what the other person is saying, and none at all to what really matters: the
Being of the other person underneath the words and the mind. Of course, you cannot
feel someone else's Being except through your own. This is the beginning of the
realization of oneness, which is love. At the deepest level of Being, you are one with
all that is.
Most human relationships consist mainly of minds interacting with each other, not of
human beings communicating, being in communion. No relationship can thrive in
that way, and that is why there is so much conflict in relationships. When the mind is
running your life, conflict, strife and problems are inevitable. Being in touch with
your inner body creates a clear space of no-mind within which the relationship can
flower.

7. PORTALS INTO THE UNMANIFESTED



Going Deeply Into The Body
I can feel the energy inside my body, especially in my arms and legs, but I don't seem
to be able to go more deeply, as you suggested earlier.
Make it into a meditation. It needn't take long. Ten to fifteen minutes of clock time
should be sufficient. Make sure first that there are no external distractions such as
telephones or people who are likely to interrupt you. Sit on a chair, but don't lean
back. Keep the spine erect. Doing so will help you to stay alert. Alternatively, choose
your own favorite position for meditation.
Make sure the body is relaxed. Close your eyes. Take a few deep breaths. Feel
yourself breathing into the lower abdomen, as it were. Observe how it expands and
contracts slightly with each in and out breath. Then become aware of the entire inner
energy field of the body. Don't think about it­feel it. By doing this, you reclaim con-
sciousness from the mind. If you find it helpful, use the "light" visualization I
described earlier.
When you can feel the inner body clearly as a single field of energy, let go, if
possible, of any visual image and focus exclusively on the feeling. If you can, also
drop any mental image you may still have of the physical body. All that is left then is
an all-encompassing sense of presence or "beingness," and the inner body is felt to be
without a boundary. Then take your attention even more deeply into that feeling.
Become one with it. Merge with the energy field, so that there is no longer a
perceived duality of the observer and the observed, of you and your body. The
distinction between inner and outer also dissolves now, so there is no inner body
anymore. By going deeply into the body, you have transcended the body.
Stay in this realm of pure Being for as long as feels comfortable; then become aware
again of the physical body, your breathing and physical senses, and open your eyes.
Look at your surroundings for a few minutes in a meditative way - that is, without
labeling them mentally -- and continue to feel the inner body as you do so. Having
access to that formless realm is truly liberating. It frees you from bondage to form
and identification with form. It is life in its undifferentiated state prior to its
fragmentation into multiplicity. We may call it the Unmanifested, the invisible
Source of all things, the Being within all beings. It is a realm of deep stillness and


                                          83

peace, but also of joy and intense aliveness. Whenever you are present, you become
`transparent' to some extent to the light, the pure consciousness that emanates from
this Source. You also realize that the light is not separate from who you are but
constitutes your very essence.


The Source Of Chi
Is the Unmanifested what in the East is called chi, a kind of universal life energy?
No, it isn't. The Unmanifested is the source of chi. Chi is the inner energy field of
your body. It is the bridge between the outer you and the Source. It lies halfway
between the manifested, the world of form, and the Unmanifested. Chi can be likened
to a river or an energy stream. If you take the focus of your consciousness deeply into
the inner body, you are tracing the course of this river back to its Source. Chi is
movement; the Unmanifested is stillness. When you reach a point of absolute
stillness, which is nevertheless vibrant with life, you have gone beyond the inner
body and beyond chi to the Source itself the Unmanifested. Chi is the link between
the Unmanifested and the physical universe.
So if you take your attention deeply into the inner body, you may reach this point,
this singularity, where the world dissolves into the Unmanifested and the
Unmanifested takes on form as the energy stream of chi, which then becomes the
world. This is the point of birth and death. When your consciousness is directed
outward, mind and world arise. When it is directed inward, it realizes its own Source
and returns home into the Unmanifested. Then, when your consciousness comes back
to the manifested world, you reassume the form identity that you temporarily
relinquished. You have a name, a past, a life situation, a future. But in one essential
respect, you are not the same person you were before: You will have glimpsed a
reality within yourself that is not "of this world," although it isn't separate from it, just
as it isn't separate from you.
Now let your spiritual practice be this: As you go about your life, don't give 100
percent of your attention to the external world and to your mind. Keep some within. I
have spoken about this already. Feel the inner body even when engaged in everyday
activities, especially when engaged in relationships or when you are relating with
nature. Feel the stillness deep inside it. Keep the portal open. It is quite possible to be
conscious of the Unmanifested throughout your life. You feel it as a deep sense of
peace somewhere in the background, a stillness that never leaves you, no matter what
happens out here. You become a bridge between the Unmanifested and the
manifested, between God and the world. This is the state of connectedness with the
Source that we call enlightenment.

                                             84

Don't get the impression that the Unmanifested is separate from the manifested. How
could it be? It is the life within every form, the inner essence of all that exists. It
pervades this world. Let me explain.


Dreamless Sleep
You take a journey into the Unmanifested every night when you enter the phase of
deep dreamless sleep. You merge with the Source. You draw from it the vital energy
that sustains you for a while when you return to the manifested, the world of separate
forms. This energy is much more vital than food: "Man does not live by bread alone."
But in dreamless sleep, you don't go into it consciously. Although the bodily
functions are still operating, "you" no longer exist in that state. Can you imagine
what it would be like to go into dreamless sleep with full consciousness? It is
impossible to imagine it, because that state has no content.
The Unmanifested does not liberate you until you enter it consciously. That's why
Jesus did not say the truth will make you free, but rather: "You will know the truth,
and the truth will make you free." This is not a conceptual truth. It is the truth of
eternal life beyond form, which is known directly or not at all. But don' t attempt to
stay conscious in dreamless sleep. It is highly unlikely that you will succeed. At most,
you may remain conscious during the dream phase, but not beyond that. This is called
lucid dreaming, which may be interesting and fascinating, but it is not liberating.
So use your inner body as a portal through which you enter the Unmanifested, and
keep that portal open so that you stay connected with the Source at all times. It makes
no difference, as far as the inner body is concerned, whether your outer physical body
is old or young, frail or strong. The inner body is timeless. If you are not yet able to
feel the inner body, use one of the other portals, although ultimately they are all one.
Some I have spoken about at length already, but I'll mention them again briefly here.


Other Portals
The Now can be seen as the main portal. It is an essential aspect of every other portal,
including the inner body. You cannot be in your body without being intensely present
in the Now.
Time and the manifested are as inextricably linked as are the timeless Now and the
Unmanifested. When you dissolve psychological time through intense present-
moment awareness, you become conscious of the Unmanifested both directly and
indirectly. Directly, you feel it as the radiance and power of your conscious presence
- no content, just presence. Indirectly, you are aware of the Unmanifested in and
through the sensory realm. In other words, you feel the God-essence in every

                                             85

creature, every flower, every stone, and you realize: `All that is, is holy." This is why
Jesus, speaking entirely from his essence or Christ identity, says in the Gospel of
Thomas: "Split a piece of wood; I am there. Lift up a stone, and you will find me
there."
Another portal into the Unmanifested is created through the cessation of thinking.
This can start with a very simple thing, such as taking one conscious breath or
looking, in a state of intense alertness, at a flower, so that there is no mental
commentary running at the same time. There are many ways to create a gap in the
incessant stream of thought. This is what meditation is all about. Thought is part of
the realm of the manifested. Continuous mind activity keeps you imprisoned in the
world of form and becomes an opaque screen that prevents you from becoming
conscious of the Unmanifested, conscious of the formless and timeless God-essence
in yourself and in all things and all creatures. When you are intensely present, you
don't need to be concerned about the cessation of thinking, of course, because the
mind then stops automatically. That's why I said the Now is an essential aspect of
every other portal.
Surrender - the letting go of mental-emotional resistance to what is - also becomes a
portal into the Unmanifested. The reason for this is simple: inner resistance cuts you
off from other people, from yourself, from the world around you. It strengthens the
feeling of separateness on which the ego depends for its survival. The stronger the
feeling of separateness, the more you are bound to the manifested, to the world of
separate forms. The more you are bound to the world of form, the harder and more
impenetrable your form identity becomes. The portal is closed, and you are cut off
from the inner dimension, the dimension of depth. In the state of surrender, your form
identity softens and becomes somewhat "transparent," as it were, so the
Unmanifested can shine through you.
Ifs up to you to open a portal in your life that gives you conscious access to the
Unmanifested. Get in touch with the energy field of the inner body, be intensely
present, disidentify from the mind, surrender to what is; these are all portals you can
use - but you only need to use one.
Surely love must also be one of those portals?
No, it isn't. As soon as one of the portals is open, love is present in you as the
"feeling-realization" of oneness. Love isn't a portal; it's what comes through the
portal into this world. As long as you are completely trapped in your form identity,
there can be no love. Your task is not to search for love but to find a portal through
which love can enter.



                                          86

Silence
Are there any other portals apart from those you just mentioned?
Yes, there are. The Unmanifested is not separate from the manifested. It pervades this
world, but it is so well disguised that almost everybody misses it completely. If you
know where to look, you'll find it everywhere. A portal opens up every moment.
Do you hear that dog barking in the distance? Or that car passing by? Listen
carefully. Can you feel the presence of the Unmanifested in that? You can' t? Look
for it in the silence out of which the sounds come and into which they return. Pay
more attention to the silence than to the sounds. Paying attention to outer silence
creates inner silence: the mind becomes still. A portal is opening up.
Every sound is born out of silence, dies back into silence, and during its life span is
surrounded by silence. Silence enables the sound tobe. It is an intrinsic but
unmanifested part of every sound, every musical note, every song, every word. The
Unmanifested is present in this world as silence. This is why it has been said that
nothing in this world is so like God as silence. All you have to do is pay attention to
it. Even during a conversation, become conscious of the gaps between words, the
brief silent intervals between sentences. As you do that, the dimension of stillness
grows within you. You cannot pay attention to silence without simultaneously
becoming still within. Silence without, stillness within. You have entered the
Unmanifested.


Space
just as no sound can exist without silence, nothing can exist without no-thing, without
the empty space that enables it to be. Every physical object or body has come out of
nothing, is surrounded by nothing, and will eventually return to nothing. Not only
that, but even inside every physical body there is far more "nothing" than
"something." Physicists tell us that the solidity of matter is an illusion. Even
seemingly solid matter, including your physical body, is nearly 100 percent empty
space - so vast are the distances between the atoms compared to their size. What is
more, even inside every atom there is mostly empty space. What is left is more like a
vibrational frequency than particles of solid matter, more like a musical note.
Buddhists have known that for over 2,500 years. "Form is emptiness, emptiness is
form," states the Heart Sutra, one of the best known ancient Buddhist texts. The
essence of all things is emptiness.
The Unmanifested is not only present in this world as silence; it also pervades the
entire physical universe as space - from within and without. This is just as easy to



                                           87

miss as silence. Everybody pays attention to the things in space, but who pays
attention to space itself?


You seem to be implying that "emptiness" or "nothing" is not just nothing, that there
is some mysterious quality to it. What is this nothing?
You cannot ask such a question. Your mind is trying to make nothing into something.
The moment you make it into something, you have missed it. Nothing - space - is the
appearance of the Unmanifested as an externalized phenomenon in a sense-perceived
world. That's about as much as one can say about it, and even that is a kind of
paradox. It cannot become an object of knowledge. You can't do a Ph.D. on
"nothing." When scientists study space, they usually make it into something and
thereby miss its essence entirely. Not surprisingly, the latest theory is that space isn't
empty at all, that it is filled with some substance. Once you have a theory, it's not too
hard to find evidence to substantiate it, at least until some other theory comes along.
"Nothing" can only become a portal into the Unmanifested for you if you don't try to
grasp or understand it.


Isn't that what we are doing here?
Not at all. I am giving you pointers to show you how you can bring the dimension of
the Unmanifested into your life. We are not trying to understand it. There is nothing
to understand.
Space has no "existence." "To exist" literally means "to stand out." You cannot
understand space because it doesn't stand out. Although in itself it has no existence, it
enables everything else to exist. Silence has no existence either, nor does the
Unmanifested.
So what happens if you withdraw attention from the objects in space and become
aware of space itself? What is the essence of this room? The furniture, pictures, and
so on arein the room, but they are not the room. The floor, walls, and ceiling define
the boundary of the room, but they are not the room either. So what is the essence of
the room? Space, of course, empty space. There would be no "room' without it. Since
space is "nothing," we can say that what is not there is more important than what is
there. So become aware of the space that is all around you. Don't think about it. Feel
it, as it were. Pay attention to "nothing."
As you do that, a shift in consciousness takes place inside you. Here is why. The
inner equivalent to objects in space such as furniture, walls, and so on are your mind
objects: thoughts, emotions, and the objects of the senses. And the inner equivalent of


                                             88

space is the consciousness that enables your mind objects to be, just as space allows
all things to be. So if you withdraw attention from things - objects in space - you
automatically withdraw attention from your mind objects as well. In other words:
You cannot think and be aware of space - or of silence, for that matter. By becoming
aware of the empty space around you, you simultaneously become aware of the space
of no-mind, of pure consciousness: the Unmanifested. This is how the contemplation
of space can become a portal for you.
Space and silence are two aspects of the same thing, the same nothing. They are an
externalization of inner space and inner silence, which is stillness: the infinitely
creative womb of all existence. Most humans are completely unconscious of this
dimension. There is no inner space, no stillness. They are out of balance. In other
words, they know the world, or think they do, but they don't know God. They identify
exclusively with their own physical and psychological form, unconscious of essence.
And because every form is highly unstable, they live in fear. This fear causes a deep
misperception of themselves and of other humans, a distortion in their vision of the
world.
If some cosmic convulsion brought about the end of our world, the Unmanifested
would remain totally unaffected by this. A Course in Miracles expresses this truth
poignantly: "Nothing real can be threatened. Nothing unreal exists. Herein lies the
peace of God."
If you remain in conscious connection with the Unmanifested, you value, love, and
deeply respect the manifested and every life form in it as an expression of the One
Life beyond form. You also know that every form is destined to dissolve again and
that ultimately nothing out here matters all that much. You have "overcome the
world," in the words of Jesus, or, as the Buddha put it, you have "crossed over to the
other shore."


The True Nature Of Space And Time
Now consider this: If there were nothing but silence, it wouldn't exist for you; you
wouldn't know what it is. Only when sound appears does silence come into being.
Similarly, if there were only space without any objects in space, it wouldn't exist for
you. Imagine yourself as a point of consciousness floating in the vastness of space -
no stars, no galaxies, just emptiness. Suddenly, space wouldn't be vast anymore; it
would not be there at all. There would be no speed, no movement from here to there.
At least two points of reference are needed for distance and space to come into being.
Space comes into being the moment the One becomes two, and as "two" become the



                                          89

"ten thousand things," as Lao Tse calls the manifested world, space becomes more
and more vast. So world and space arise simultaneously.
Nothing could be without space, yet space is nothing. Before the universe came into
being, before the "big bang" if you like, there wasn't a vast empty space waiting to be
filled. There was no space, as there was no thing. There was only the Unmanifested -
the One. When the One became "the ten thousand things," suddenly space seemed to
be there and enabled the many to be. Where did it come from? Was it created by God
to accommodate the universe? Of course not. Space is no-thing, so it was never
created.
Go out on a clear night and look up at the sky. The thousands of stars you can see
with the naked eye are no more than an infinitesimal fraction of what is there. Over
100 billion galaxies can already be detected with the most powerful telescopes, each
galaxy an "island universe" with billions of stars. Yet what is even more awe-
inspiring is the infinity of space itself, the depth and stillness that allows all of that
magnificence to be. Nothing could be more awe-inspiring and majestic than the
inconceivable vastness and stillness of space, and yet what is it? Emptiness, vast
emptiness.
What appears to us as space in our universe perceived through the mind and the
senses is the Unmanifested itself, externalized. It is the "body" of God. And the
greatest miracle is this: That stillness and vastness that enables the universe to be, is
not just out there in space - it is also within you. When you are utterly and totally
present, you encounter it as the still inner space of no-mind. Within you, it is vast in
depth, not in extension. Spatial extension is ultimately a misperception of infinite
depth - an attribute of the one transcendental reality.


According to Einstein, space and time are not separate. I don't really understand it,
but I think he is saying that time is the fourth dimension of space. He calls it the
"space-time continuum."
Yes. What you perceive externally as space and time are ultimately illusory, but they
contain a core of truth. They are the two essential attributes of God, infinity and
eternity, perceived as if they had an external existence outside you. Within you, both
space and time have an inner equivalent that reveals their true nature, as well as your
own. Whereas space is the still, infinitely deep realm of no-mind, the inner equivalent
of time is presence, awareness of the eternal Now. Remember that there is no
distinction between them. When space and time are realized within as the
Unmanifested - no-mind and presence - external space and time continue to exist for



                                            90

you, but they become much less important. The world, too, continues to exist for you,
but it will not bind you anymore.
Hence, the ultimate purpose of the world lies not within the world but in
transcendence of the world. Just as you would not be conscious of space if there were
no objects in space, the world is needed for the Unmanifested to be realized. You
may have heard the Buddhist saying: "If there were no illusion, there would be no
enlightenment." It is through the world and ultimately through you that the
Unmanifested knows itself. You are here to enable the divine purpose of the universe
to unfold. That is how important you are!


Conscious Death
Apart from dreamless sleep, which I mentioned already, there is one other
involuntary portal. It opens up briefly at the time of physical death. Even if you have
missed all the other opportunities for spiritual realization during your lifetime, one
last portal will open up for you immediately after the body has died.
There are countless accounts by people who had a visual impression of this portal as
radiant light and then returned from what is commonly known as a near-death
experience. Many of them also spoke of a sense of blissful serenity and deep peace.
In the Tibetan Book of the Dead, it is described as "the luminous splendor of the col-
orless light of Emptiness," which it says is "your own true self." This portal opens up
only very briefly, and unless you have already encountered the dimension of the
Unmanifested in your lifetime, you will likely miss it. Most people carry too much
residual resistance, too much fear, too much attachment to sensory experience, too
much identification with the manifested world. So they see the portal, turn away in
fear, and then lose consciousness. Most of what happens after that is involuntary and
automatic. Eventually, there will be another round of birth and death. Their presence
wasn't strong enough yet for conscious immortality.


So going through this portal does not mean annihilation?
As with all the other portals, your radiant true nature remains, but not the personality.
In any case, whatever is real or of true value in your personality is your true nature
shining through. This is never lost. Nothing that is of value, nothing that is real, is
ever lost.
Approaching death and death itself, the dissolution of the physical form, is always a
great opportunity for spiritual realization. This opportunity is tragically missed most




                                            91

of the time, since we live in a culture that is almost totally ignorant of death, as it is
almost totally ignorant of anything that truly matters.
Every portal is a portal of death, the death of the false self. When you go through it,
you cease to derive your identity from your psychological, mind-made form. You
then realize that death is an illusion, just as your identification with form was an
illusion. The end of illusion - that's all that death is. It is painful only as long as you
cling to illusion.

8. ENLIGHTENED RELATIONSHIPS



Enter The Now From Wherever You Are
I always thought that true enlightenment is not possible except through love in a
relationship between a man and a woman. Isn't this what makes us whole again?
How can one's life be fufilled until that happens?
Is that true in your experience? Has this happened to you?


Not yet, but how could it be otherwise? I know that it will happen.
In other words, you are waiting for an event in time to save you. Is this not the core
error that we have been talking about? Salvation is not elsewhere in place or time. It
is here and now.


What does that statement mean, "salvation is here and now"? I don't understand it. I
don't even know what salvation means.
Most people pursue physical pleasures or various forms of psychological gratification
because they believe that those things will make them happy or free them from a
feeling of fear or lack. Happiness may be perceived as a heightened sense of
aliveness attained through physical pleasure, or a more secure and more complete
sense of self attained through some form of psychological gratification. This is the
search for salvation from a state of unsatisfactoriness or insufficiency. Invariably, any
satisfaction that they obtain is short-lived, so the condition of satisfaction or
fulfillment is usually projected once again onto an imaginary point away from the
here and now. "When I obtain this or am free of that - then I will be okay." This is the
unconscious mind-set that creates the illusion of salvation in the future.
True salvation is fulfillment, peace, life in all its fullness. It is to be who you are, to
feel within you the good that has no opposite, the joy of Being that depends on
nothing outside itself. It is felt not as a passing experience but as an abiding presence.
In theistic language, it is to "know God" - not as something outside you but as your
own innermost essence. True salvation is to know yourself as an inseparable part of
the timeless and formless One Life from which all that exists derives its being.




                                              93

True salvation is a state of freedom - from fear, from suffering, from a perceived state
of lack and insufficiency and therefore from all wanting, needing, grasping, and
clinging. It is freedom from compulsive thinking, from negativity, and above all from
past and future as a psychological need. Your mind is telling you that you cannot get
there from here. Something needs to happen, or you need to become this or that
before you can be free and fulfilled. It is saying, in fact, that you need time - that you
need to find, sort out, do, achieve, acquire, become, or understand something before
you can be free or complete. You see time as the means to salvation, whereas in truth
it is the greatest obstacle to salvation. You think that you can't get there from where
and who you are at this moment because you are not yet complete or good enough,
but the truth is that here and now is the only point from where you can get there. You
"get' there by realizing that you are there already. You find God the moment you
realize that you don't need to seek God. So there is no only way to salvation: Any
condition can be used, but no particular condition is needed. However, there is only
one point of access: the Now. There can be no salvation away from this moment. You
are lonely and without a partner? Enter the Now from there. You are in a
relationship? Enter the Now from there.
There is nothing you can ever do or attain that will get you closerto salvation than it
is at this moment. This may be hard to grasp for a mind accustomed to thinking that
everything worthwhile is in the future. Nor can anything that you ever did or that was
done to you in the past prevent you from saying yes to what is and taking your atten-
tion deeply into the Now. You cannot do this in the future. You do it now or not at
all.


Love/Hate Relationships
Unless and until you access the consciousness frequency of presence, all
relationships, and particularly intimate relationships, are deeply flawed and ultimately
dysfunctional. They may seem perfect for a while, such as when you are "in love,"
but invariably that apparent perfection gets disrupted as arguments, conflicts,
dissatisfaction, and emotional or even physical violence occur with increasing
frequency. It seems that most "love relationships" become love/hate relationships
before long. Love can then turn into savage attack, feelings of hostility, or complete
withdrawal of affection at the flick of a switch. This is considered normal. The
relationship then oscillates for a while, a few months or a few years, between the
polarities of "love" and hate, and it gives you as much pleasure as it gives you pain. It
is not uncommon for couples to become addicted to those cycles. Their drama makes
them feel alive. When a balance between the positive/ negative polarities is lost and


                                            94

the negative, destructive cycles occur with increasing frequency and intensity, which
tends to happen sooner or later, then it will not be long before the relationship finally
collapses.
It may appear that if you could only eliminate the negative or destructive cycles, then
all would be well and the relationship would flower beautifully - but alas, this is not
possible. The polarities are mutually interdependent. You cannot have one without
the other. The positive already contains within itself the as yet unmanifested negative.
Both are in fact different aspects of the same dysfunction. I am speaking here of what
is commonly called romantic relationships - not of true love, which has no opposite
because it arises from beyond the mind. Love as a continuous state is as yet very rare
- as rare as conscious human beings. Brief and elusive glimpses of love, however, are
possible whenever there is a gap in the stream of mind.
The negative side of a relationship is, of course, more easily recognizable as
dysfunctional than the positive one. And it is also easier to recognize the source of
negativity in your partner than to see it in yourself. It can manifest in many forms:
possessiveness, jealousy, control, withdrawal and unspoken resentment, the need to
be right, insensitivity and self-absorption, emotional demands and manipulation, the
urge to argue, criticize, judge, blame, or attack, anger, unconscious revenge for past
pain inflicted by a parent, rage and physical violence.
On the positive side, you are "in love" with your partner. This is at first a deeply
satisfying state. You feel intensely alive. Your existence has suddenly become
meaningful because someone needs you, wants you, and makes you feel special, and
you do the same for him or her. When you are together, you feel whole. The feeling
can become so intense that the rest of the world fades into insignificance.
However, you may also have noticed that there is a neediness and a clinging quality
to that intensity. You become addicted to the other person. He or she acts on you like
a drug. You are on a high when the drug is available, but even the possibility or the
thought that he or she might no longer be there for you can lead to jealousy,
possessiveness, attempts at manipulation through emotional blackmail, blaming and
accusing - fear of loss. If the other person does leave you, this can give rise to the
most intense hostility or the most profound grief and despair. In an instant, loving
tenderness can turn into a savage attack or dreadful grief. Where is the love now? Can
love change into its opposite in an instant? Was it love in the first place, or just an
addictive grasping and clinging?


Addiction And The Search For Wholeness
Why should we become addicted to another person?

                                            95

The reason why the romantic love relationship is such an intense and universally
sought-after experience is that it seems to offer liberation from a deep-seated state of
fear, need, lack, and incompleteness that is part of the human condition in its
unredeemed and unenlightened state. There is a physical as well as a psychological
dimension to this state.
On the physical level, you are obviously not whole, nor will you ever be: You are
either a man or a woman, which is to say, one-half of the whole. On this level, the
longing for wholeness - the return to oneness - manifests as male-female attraction,
man's need for a woman, woman's need for a man. It is an almost irresistible urge for
union with the opposite energy polarity. The root of this physical urge is a spiritual
one: the longing for an end to duality, a return to the state of wholeness. Sexual union
is the closest you can get to this state on the physical level. This is why it is the most
deeply satisfying experience the physical realm can offer. But sexual union is no
more than a fleeting glimpse of wholeness, an instant of bliss. As long as it is
unconsciously sought as a means of salvation, you are seeking the end of duality on
the level of form, where it cannot be found. You are given a tantalizing glimpse of
heaven, but you are not allowed to dwell there, and find yourself again in a separate
body.
On the psychological level, the sense of lack and incompleteness is, if anything, even
greater than on the physical level. As long as you are identified with the mind, you
have an externally derived sense of self. That is to say, you get your sense of who you
are from things that ultimately have nothing to do with who you are: your social role,
possessions, external appearance, successes and failures, belief systems, and so on.
This false, mind-made self, the ego, feels vulnerable, insecure, and is always seeking
new things to identify with to give it a feeling that it exists. But nothing is ever
enough to give it lasting fulfillment. Its fear remains; its sense of lack and neediness
remains.
But then that special relationship comes along. It seems to he the answer to all the
ego's problems and to meet all its needs. At least this is how it appears at first. All the
other things that you derived your sense of self from before, now become relatively
insignificant. You now have a single focal point that replaces them all, gives meaning
to your life, and through which you define your identity. the person you are "in love"
with. You are no longer a disconnected fragment in an uncaring universe, or so it
seems. Your world now has a center: the loved one. The fact that the center is outside
you and that, therefore, you still have an externally derived sense of self does not
seem to matter at first. What matters is that the underlying feelings of incom-
pleteness, of fear, lack and unfulfillment so characteristic of the egoic state are no


                                             96

longer there - or are they? Have they dissolved, or do they continue to exist
underneath the happy surface reality?
If in your relationships you experience both "love" and the opposite of love - attack,
emotional violence, and so on - then it is likely that you are confusing ego attachment
and addictive clinging with love. You cannot love your partner one moment and
attack him or her the next. True love has no opposite. If your "love" has an opposite,
then it is not love but a strong ego-need for a more complete and deeper sense of self,
a need that the other person temporarily meets. It is the ego's substitute for salvation,
and for a short time it almost does feel like salvation.
But there comes a point when your partner behaves in ways that fail to meet your
needs, or rather those of your ego. The feelings of fear, pain, and lack that are an
intrinsic part of egoic consciousness but had been covered up by the "love
relationship" now resurface. Just as with every other addiction, you are on a high
when the drug is available, but invariably there comes a time when the drug no longer
works for you. When those painful feelings reappear, you feel them even more
strongly than before, and what is more, you now perceive your partner as the cause of
those feelings. This means that you project them outward and attack the other with all
the savage violence that is part of your pain. This attack may awaken the partner's
own pain, and he or she may counter your attack. At this point, the ego is still uncon-
sciously hoping that its attack or its attempts at manipulation will be sufficient
punishment to induce your partner to change their behavior, so that it can use them
again as a cover-up for your pain.
Every addiction arises from an unconscious refusal to face and move through your
own pain. Every addiction starts with pain and ends with pain. Whatever the
substance you are addicted to - alcohol, food, legal or illegal drugs, or a person - you
are using something or somebody to cover up your pain. That is why, after the initial
euphoria has passed, there is so much unhappiness, so much pain in intimate
relationships. They do not cause pain and unhappiness. They bring out the pain and
unhappiness that is already in you. Every addiction does that. Every addiction reaches
a point where it does not work for you anymore, and then you feel the pain more
intensely than ever.
This is one reason why most people are always trying to escape from the present
moment and are seeking some kind of salvation in the future. The first thing that they
might encounter if they focused their attention on the Now is their own pain, and this
is what they fear. If they only knew how easy it is to access in the Now the power of
presence that dissolves the past and its pain, the reality that dissolves the illusion. If
they only knew how close they are to their own reality, how close to God.

                                            97

Avoidance of relationships in an attempt to avoid pain is not the answer either. The
pain is there anyway. Three failed relationships in as many years are more likely to
force you into awakening than three years on a desert island or shut away in your
room. But if you could bring intense presence into your aloneness, that would work
for you too.


From Addictive To Enlightened Relationships
Can we change an addictive relationship into a true one? Yes. Being present and
intensifying your presence by taking your attention ever more deeply into the Now:
Whether you are living alone or with a partner, this remains the key. For love to
flourish, the light of your presence needs to be strong enough so that you no longer
get taken over by the thinker or the pain-body and mistake them for who you are. To
know yourself as the Being underneath the thinker, the stillness underneath the
mental noise, the love and joy underneath the pain, is freedom, salvation,
enlightenment. To disidentify from the pain-body is to bring presence into the pain
and thus transmute it. To disidentify from thinking is to be the silent watcher of your
thoughts and behavior, especially the repetitive patterns of your mind and the roles
played by the ego.
If you stop investing it with "selfness," the mind loses its compulsive quality, which
basically is the compulsion to judge, and so to resist what is, which creates conflict,
drama, and new pain. In fact, the moment that judgment stops through acceptance of
what is, you are free of the mind. You have made room for love, for joy, for peace.
First you stop judging yourself; then you stop judging your partner. The greatest
catalyst for change in a relationship is complete acceptance of your partner as he or
she is, without needing to judge or change them in any way. That immediately takes
you beyond ego. All mind games and all addictive clinging are then over. There are
no victims and no perpetrators anymore, no accuser and accused. This is also the end
of all codependency, of being drawn into somebody else's unconscious pattern and
thereby enabling it to continue. You will then either separate - in love - or move ever
more deeply into the Now together - into Being. Can it be that simple? Yes, it is that
simple.
Love is a state of Being. Your love is not outside; it is deep within you. You can
never lose it, and it cannot leave you. It is not dependent on some other body, some
external form. In the stillness of your presence, you can feel your own formless and
timeless reality as the unmanifested life that animates your physical form. You can
then feel the same life deep within every other human and every other creature. You



                                           98

look beyond the veil of form and separation. This is the realization of oneness. This is
love.
What is God? The eternal One Life underneath all the forms of life. What is love? To
feel the presence of that One Life deep within yourself and within all creatures. To be
it. Therefore, all love is the love of God.
Love is not selective, just as the light of the sun is not selective. It does not make one
person special. It is not exclusive. Exclusivity is not the love of God but the "love" of
ego. However, the intensity with which true love is felt can vary. There may be one
person who reflects your love back to you more clearly and more intensely than
others, and if that person feels the same toward you, it can be said that you are in a
love relationship with him or her. The bond that connects you with that person is the
same bond that connects you with the person sitting next to you on a bus, or with a
bird, a tree, a flower. Only the degree of intensity with which it is felt differs.
Even in an otherwise addictive relationship, there may be moments when something
more real shines through, something beyond your mutual addictive needs. These are
moments when both your and your partner's mind briefly subside and the pain-body
is temporarily in a dormant state. This may sometimes happen during physical
intimacy, or when you are both witnessing the miracle of childbirth, or in the
presence of death, or when one of you is seriously ill - anything that renders the mind
powerless. When this happens, your Being, which is usually buried underneath the
mind, becomes revealed, and it is this that makes true communication possible.
True communication is communion - the realization of oneness, which is love.
Usually, this is quickly lost again, unless you are able to stay present enough to keep
out the mind and its old patterns. As soon as the mind and mind identification return,
you are no longer yourself but a mental image of yourself, and you start playing
games and roles again to get your ego needs met. You are a human mind again,
pretending to be a human being, interacting with another mind, playing a drama
called "love."
Although brief glimpses are possible, love cannot flourish unless you are
permanently free of mind identification and your presence is intense enough to have
dissolved the pain-body - or you can at least remain present as the watcher. The pain-
body cannot then take you over and so become destructive of love.


Relationships As Spiritual Practice
As the egoic mode of consciousness and all the social, political, and economic
structures that it created enter the final stage of collapse, the relationships between
men and women reflect the deep state of crisis in which humanity now finds itself. As

                                             99

humans have become increasingly identified with their mind, most relationships are
not rooted in Being and so turn into a source of pain and become dominated by
problems and conflict.
Millions are now living alone or as single parents, unable to establish an intimate
relationship or unwilling to repeat the insane drama of past relationships. Others go
from one relationship to another, from one pleasure-and-pain cycle to another, in
search of the elusive goal of fulfillment through union with the opposite energy
polarity. Still others compromise and continue to be together in a dysfunctional
relationship in which negativity prevails, for the sake of the children or security,
through force of habit, fear of being alone, or some other mutually "beneficial"
arrangement, or even through the unconscious addiction to the excitement of
emotional drama and pain.
However, every crisis represents not only danger but also opportunity. If relationships
energize and magnify egoic mind patterns and activate the pain-body, as they do at
this time, why not accept this fact rather than try to escape from it? Why not
cooperate with it instead of avoiding relationships or continuing to pursue the
phantom of an ideal partner as an answer to your problems or a means of feeling ful-
filled? The opportunity that is concealed within every crisis does not manifest until
all the facts of any given situation are acknowledged and fully accepted. As long as
you deny them, as long as you try to escape from them or wish that things were
different, the window of opportunity does not open up, and you remain trapped inside
that situation, which will remain the same or deteriorate further.
With the acknowledgment and acceptance of the facts also comes a degree of
freedom from them. For example, when you know there is disharmony and you hold
that "knowing," through your knowing a new factor has come in, and the disharmony
cannot remain unchanged. When you know you are not at peace, your knowing cre-
ates a still space that surrounds your nonpeace in a loving and tender embrace and
then transmutes your nonpeace into peace. As far as inner transformation is
concerned, there is nothing you can do about it. You cannot transform yourself, and
you certainly cannot transform your partner or anybody else. All you can do is create
a space for transformation to happen, for grace and love to enter.
So whenever your relationship is not working, whenever it brings out the "madness"
in you and in your partner, be glad. What was unconscious is being brought up to the
light. It is an opportunity for salvation. Every moment, hold the knowing of that
moment, particularly of your inner state. If there is anger, know that there is anger. If
there is jealousy, defensiveness, the urge to argue, the need to be right, an inner child
demanding love and attention, or emotional pain of any kind - whatever it is, know

                                           100

the reality of that moment and hold the knowing. The relationship then becomes your
sadhana, your spiritual practice. If you observe unconscious behavior in your partner,
hold it in the loving embrace of your knowing so that you won't react.
Unconsciousness and knowing cannot coexist for long - even if the knowing is only
in the other person and not in the one who is acting out the unconsciousness. The
energy form that lies behind hostility and attack finds the presence of love absolutely
intolerable. If you react at all to your partner's unconsciousness, you become uncon-
scious yourself. But if you then remember to know your reaction, nothing is lost.
Humanity is under great pressure to evolve because it is our only chance of survival
as a race. This will affect every aspect of your life and close relationships in
particular. Never before have relationships been as problematic and conflict ridden as
they are now. As you may have noticed, they are not here to make you happy or
fulfilled. If you continue to pursue the goal of salvation through a relationship, you
will be disillusioned again and again. But if you accept that the relationship is here to
make you conscious instead of happy, then the relationship will offer you salvation,
and you will be aligning yourself with the higher consciousness that wants to be born
into this world. For those who hold on to the old patterns, there will be increasing
pain, violence, confusion, and madness.


I suppose that it takes two to make a relationship into a spiritual practice, as you
suggest. For example, my partner is still acting out his old patterns of jealousy and
control. I have pointed this out many times, but he is unable to see it.
How many people does it take to make your life into a spiritual practice? Never mind
if your partner will not cooperate. Sanity - consciousness - can only come into this
world through you. You do not need to wait for the world to become sane, or for
somebody else to become conscious, before you can be enlightened. You may wait
forever. Do not accuse each other of being unconscious. The moment you start to
argue, you have identified with a mental position and are now defending not only that
position but also your sense of self. The ego is in charge. You have become
unconscious. At times, it may be appropriate to point out certain aspects of your
partner's behavior. If you are very alert, very present, you can do so without ego
involvement - without blaming, accusing, or making the other wrong.
When your partner behaves unconsciously, relinquish all judgment. Judgment is
either to confuse someone's unconscious behavior with who they are or to project
your own unconsciousness onto another person and mistake that for who they are. To
relinquish judgment does not mean that you do not recognize dysfunction and
unconsciousness when you see it. It means "being the knowing" rather than "being

                                           101

the reaction'' and the judge. You will then either be totally free of reaction or you may
react and still be the knowing, the space in which the reaction is watched and allowed
to be. Instead of fighting the darkness, you bring in the light. Instead of reacting to
delusion, you see the delusion yet at the same time look through it. Being the
knowing creates a clear space of loving presence that allows all things and all people
to be as they are. No greater catalyst for transformation exists. If you practice this,
your partner cannot stay with you and remain unconscious.
If you both agree that the relationship will be your spiritual practice, so much the
better. You can then express your thoughts and feelings to each other as soon as they
occur, or as soon as a reaction comes up, so that you do not create a time gap in
which an unexpressed or unacknowledged emotion or grievance can fester and grow.
Learn to give expression to what you feel without blaming. Learn to listen to your
partner in an open, nondefensive way. Give your partner space for expressing himself
or herself. Be present. Accusing, defending, attacking - all those patterns that are
designed to strengthen or protect the ego or to get its needs met will then become
redundant. Giving space to others - and to yourself - is vital. Love cannot flourish
without it. When you have removed the two factors that are destructive of
relationships: When the pain-body has been transmuted and you are no longer
identified with mind and mental positions, and if your partner has done the same, you
will experience the bliss of the flowering of relationship. Instead of mirroring to each
other your pain and your unconsciousness, instead of satisfying your mutual addictive
ego needs, you will reflect back to each other the love that you feel deep within, the
love that comes with the realization of your oneness with all that is. This is the love
that has no opposite.
If your partner is still identified with the mind and the pain-body while you are
already free, this will represent a major challenge - not to you but to your partner. It is
not easy to live with an enlightened person, or rather it is so easy that the ego finds it
extremely threatening. Remember that the ego needs problems, conflict, and
"enemies" to strengthen the sense of separateness on which its identity depends. The
unenlightened partner's mind will be deeply frustrated because its fixed positions are
not resisted, which means they will become shaky and weak, and there is even the
"danger" that they may collapse altogether, resulting in loss of self. The pain-body is
demanding feedback and not getting it. The need for argument, drama, and conflict is
not being met. But beware: Some people who are unresponsive, withdrawn,
insensitive, or cut off from their feelings may think and try to convince others that
they are enlightened, or at least that there is "nothing wrong" with them and
everything wrong with their partner. Men tend to do that more than women. They


                                           102

may see their female partners as irrational or emotional. But if you can feel your
emotions, you are not far from the radiant inner body just underneath. If you are
mainly in your head, the distance is much greater, and you need to bring
consciousness into the emotional body before you can reach the inner body.
If there isn't an emanation of love and joy, complete presence and openness toward
all beings, then it is not enlightenment. Another indicator is how a person behaves in
difficult or challenging situations or when things "go wrong." If your "enlightenment"
is egoic self-delusion, then life will soon give you a challenge that will bring out your
unconsciousness in whatever form - as fear, anger, defensiveness, judgment,
depression, and so on. If you are in a relationship, many of your challenges will come
through your partner. For example, a woman may be challenged by an unresponsive
male partner who lives almost entirely in his head. She will be challenged by his
inability to hear her, to give her attention and space to be, which is due to his lack of
presence. The absence of love in the relationship, which is usually more keenly felt
by a woman than a man, will trigger the woman's pain-body, and through it she will
attack her partner - blame, criticize, make wrong, and so on. This in turn now
becomes his challenge. To defend himself against her pain-body's attack, which he
sees as totally unwarranted, he will become even more deeply entrenched in his
mental positions as he justifies, defends himself or counterattacks. Eventually, this
may activate his own pain-body. When both partners have thus been taken over, a
level of deep unconsciousness has been reached, of emotional violence, savage attack
and counterattack. It will not subside until both painbodies have replenished
themselves and then enter the dormant stage. Until the next time.
This is only one of an endless number of possible scenarios. Many volumes have
been written, and many more could be written, about the ways in which
unconsciousness is brought out in male-female relationships. But, as I said earlier,
once you understand the root of the dysfunction, you do not need to explore its
countless manifestations.
Let's briefly look again at the scenario I have just described. Every challenge that it
contains is actually a disguised opportunity for salvation. At every stage of the
unfolding dysfunctional process, freedom from unconsciousness is possible. For
example, the woman's hostility could become a signal for the man to come out of his
mind-identified state, awaken into the Now, become present - instead of becoming
even more identified with his mind, even more unconscious. Instead of "being" the
pain-body, the woman could be the knowing that watches the emotional pain in
herself, thus accessing the power of the Now and initiating the transmutation of the
pain. This would remove the compulsive and automatic outward projection of it. She


                                            103

could then express her feelings to her partner. There is no guarantee, of course, that
he will listen, but it gives him a good chance to become present and certainly breaks
the insane cycle of the involuntary acting out of old mind patterns. If the woman
misses that opportunity, the man could watch his own mental-emotional reaction to
her pain, his own defensiveness, rather than being the reaction. He could then watch
his own pain-body being triggered and thus bring consciousness into his emotions. In
this way, a clear and still space of pure awareness would come into being - the
knowing, the silent witness, the watcher. This awareness does not deny the pain and
yet is beyond it. It allows the pain to be and yet transmutes it at the same time. It
accepts everything and transforms everything. A door would have opened up for her
through which she could easily join him in that space.
If you are consistently or at least predominantly present in your relationship, this will
be the greatest challenge for your partner. They will not be able to tolerate your
presence for very long and stay unconscious. If they are ready, they will walk through
the door that you opened for them and join you in that state. If they are not, you will
separate like oil and water. The light is too painful for someone who wants to remain
in darkness.


Why Women Are Closer To Enlightenment
Are the obstacles to enlightenment the same for a man as for a woman?
Yes, but the emphasis is different. Generally speaking, it is easier for a woman to feel
and be in her body, so she is naturally closer to Being and potentially closer to
enlightenment than a man. This is why many ancient cultures instinctively chose
female figures or analogies to represent or describe the formless and transcendental
reality. It was often seen as a womb that gives birth to everything in creation and
sustains and nourishes it during its life as form. In the Tao Te Ching, one of the most
ancient and profound books ever written, the Tao, which could be translated as Being,
is described as "infinite, eternally present, the mother of the universe." Naturally,
women are closer to it than men since they virtually "embody' the Unmanifested.
What is more, all creatures and all things must eventually return to the Source. `All
things vanish into the Tao. It alone endures." Since the Source is seen as female, this
is represented as the light and dark sides of the archetypal feminine in psychology
and mythology. The Goddess or Divine Mother has two aspects: She gives life, and
she takes life.
When the mind took over and humans lost touch with the reality of their divine
essence, they started to think of God as a male figure. Society became male
dominated, and the female was made subordinate to the male.

                                            104

I am not suggesting a return to earlier female representations of the divine. Some
people now use the term Goddess instead of God. They are redressing a balance
between male and female that was lost a long time ago, and that is good. But it is still
a representation and a concept, perhaps temporarily useful, just as a map or a signpost
is temporarily useful, but more a hindrance than a help when you are ready to realize
the reality beyond all concepts and images. What does remain true, however, is that
the energy frequency of the mind appears to be essentially male. The mind resists,
fights for control, uses, manipulates, attacks, tries to grasp and possess, and so on.
This is why the traditional God is a patriarchal, controlling authority figure, an often
angry man who you should live in fear of, as the Old Testament suggests. This God is
a projection of the human mind.
To go beyond the mind and reconnect with the deeper reality of Being, very different
qualities are needed: surrender, nonjudgment, an openness that allows life to be
instead of resisting it, the capacity to hold all things in the loving embrace of your
knowing. All these qualities are much more closely related to the female principle.
Whereas mind-energy is hard and rigid, Being-energy is soft and yielding and yet
infinitely more powerful than mind. The mind runs our civilization, whereas Being is
in charge of all life on our planet and beyond. Being is the very Intelligence whose
visible manifestation is the physical universe. Although women are potentially closer
to it, men can also access it within themselves.
At this time, the vast majority of men as well as women are still in the grip of the
mind: identified with the thinker and the pain-body. This, of course, is what prevents
enlightenment and the flowering of love. As a general rule, the major obstacle for
men tends to be the thinking mind, and the major obstacle for women the pain-body,
although in certain individual cases the opposite may be true, and in others the two
factors may be equal.


Dissolving The Collective Female Pain-Body
Why is the pain-body more of an obstacle for women?
The pain-body usually has a collective as well as a personal aspect. The personal
aspect is the accumulated residue of emotional pain suffered in one's own past. The
collective one is the pain accumulated in the collective human psyche over thousands
of years through disease, torture, war, murder, cruelty, madness, and so on.
Everyone's personal pain-body also partakes of this collective pain-body. There are
different strands in the collective pain-body. For example, certain races or countries
in which extreme forms of strife and violence occur have a heavier collective pain-
body than others. Anyone with a strong pain-body and not enough consciousness to

                                           105

disidentify from it will not only continuously or periodically be forced to relive their
emotional pain but may also easily become either the perpetrator or the victim of
violence, depending on whether their pain-body is predominantly active or passive.
On the other hand, they may also be potentially closer to enlightenment. This
potential isn't necessarily realized, of course, but if you are trapped in a nightmare
you will probably be more strongly motivated to awaken than someone who is just
caught in the ups and downs of an ordinary dream.
Apart from her personal pain-body, every woman has her share in what could be
described as the collective female pain-body - unless she is fully conscious. This
consists of accumulated pain suffered by women partly through male subjugation of
the female, through slavery, exploitation, rape, childbirth, child loss, and so on, over
thousands of years. The emotional or physical pain that for many women precedes
and coincides with the menstrual flow is the pain-body in its collective aspect that
awakens from its dormancy at that time, although it can be triggered at other times
too. It restricts the free flow of life energy through the body, of which menstruation is
a physical expression. Let's dwell on this for a moment and see how it can become an
opportunity for enlightenment.
Often a woman is "taken over" by the pain-body at that time. It has an extremely
powerful energetic charge that can easily pull you into unconscious identification
with it. You are then actively possessed by an energy field that occupies your inner
space and pretends to be you - but, of course, is not you at all. It speaks through you,
acts through you, thinks through you. It will create negative situations in your life so
that it can feed on the energy. It wants more pain, in whatever form. I have described
this process already. It can be vicious and destructive. It is pure pain, past pain - and
it is not you.
The number of women who are now approaching the fully conscious state already
exceeds that of men and will be growing even faster in the years to come. Men may
catch up with them in the end, but for some considerable time there will be a gap
between the consciousness of men and that of women. Women are regaining the
function that is their birthright and, therefore, comes to them more naturally than it
does to men: to be a bridge between the manifested world and the Unmanifested,
between physicality and spirit. Your main task as a woman now is to transmute the
pain-body so that it no longer comes between you and your true self, the essence of
who you are. Of course, you also have to deal with the other obstacle to enlight-
enment, which is the thinking mind, but the intense presence you generate when
dealing with the pain-body will also free you from identification with the mind.



                                             106

The first thing to remember is this: As long as you make an identity for yourself out
of the pain, you cannot become free of it. As long as part of your sense of self is
invested in your emotional pain, you will unconsciously resist or sabotage every
attempt that you make to heal that pain. Why? Quite simply because you want to
keep yourself intact, and the pain has become an essential part of you. This is an
unconscious process, and the only way to overcome it is to make it conscious.
To suddenly see that you are or have been attached to your pain can be quite a
shocking realization. The moment you realize this, you have broken the attachment.
The pain-body is an energy field, almost like an entity, that has become temporarily
lodged in your inner space. It is life energy that has become trapped, energy that is no
longer flowing. Of course, the pain-body is there because of certain things that
happened in the past. It is the living past in you, and if you identify with it, you
identify with the past. A victim identity is the belief that the past is more powerful
than the present, which is the opposite of the truth. It is the belief that other people
and what they did to you are responsible for who you are now, for your emotional
pain or your inability to be your true self. The truth is that the only power there is, is
contained within this moment: It is the power of your presence. Once you know that,
you also realize that you are responsible for your inner space now - nobody else is -
and that the past cannot prevail against the power of the Now.
So identification prevents you from dealing with the pain-body. Some women who
are already conscious enough to have relinquished their victim identity on the
personal level are still holding on to a collective victim identity "what men did to
women." They are right - and they are also wrong. They are right inasmuch as the
collective female painbody is in large part due to male violence inflicted on women
and repression of the female principle throughout the planet over millennia. They are
wrong if they derive a sense of self from this fact and thereby keep themselves
imprisoned in a collective victim identity. If a woman is still holding on to anger,
resentment, or condemnation, she is holding on to her pain-body. This may give her a
comforting sense of identity, of solidarity with other women, but it is keeping her in
bondage to the past and blocking full access to her essence and true power. If women
exclude themselves from men, that fosters a sense of separation and therefore a
strengthening of the ego. And the stronger the ego, the more distant you are from
your true nature.
So do not use the pain-body to give you an identity. Use it for enlightenment instead.
Transmute it into consciousness. One of the best tunes for this is during menses. I
believe that, in the years to come, many women will enter the fully conscious state
during that time. Usually, it is a time of unconsciousness for many women, as they


                                           107

are taken over by the collective female pain-body. Once you have reached a certain
level of consciousness, however, you can reverse this, so instead of becoming
unconscious you become more conscious. I have described the basic process already,
but let me take you through it again, this time with special reference to the collective
female pain-body.
When you know that the menstrual flow is approaching, before you feel the first signs
of what is commonly called premenstrual tension, the awakening of the collective
female pain-body, become very alert and inhabit your body as fully as possible.
When the first sign appears, you need to be alert enough to "catch" it before it takes
you over. For example, the first sign may be a sudden strong irritation or a flash of
anger, or it may be a purely physical symptom. Whatever it is, catch it before it can
take over your thinking or behavior. This simply means putting the spotlight of your
attention on it. If it is an emotion, feel the strong energy charge behind it. Know that
it is the painbody. At the same time, be the knowing; that is to say, be aware of your
conscious presence and feel its power. Any emotion that you take your presence into
will quickly subside and become transmuted. If it is a purely physical symptom, the
attention that you give it will prevent it from turning into an emotion or a thought.
Then continue to be alert and wait for the next sign of the pain-body. When it
appears, catch it again in the same way as before.
Later, when the pain-body has fully awakened from its dormant state, you may
experience considerable turbulence in your inner space for a while, perhaps for
several days. Whatever form this takes, stay present. Give it your complete attention.
Watch the turbulence inside you. Know it is there. Hold the knowing, and be the
knowing. Remember: do not let the pain-body use your mind and take over your
thinking. Watch it. Feel its energy directly, inside your body. As you know, full
attention means full acceptance.
Through sustained attention and thus acceptance, there comes transmutation. The
pain-body becomes transformed into radiant consciousness, just as a piece of wood,
when placed in or near a fire, itself is transformed into fire. Menstruation will then
become not only a joyful and fulfilling expression of your womanhood but also a
sacred time of transmutation, when you give birth to a new consciousness. Your true
nature then shines forth, both in its female aspect as the Goddess and in its
transcendental aspect as the divine Being that you are beyond male and female
duality.
If your male partner is conscious enough, he can help you with the practice I have
just described by holding the frequency of intense presence particularly at this time.
If he stays present whenever you fall back into unconscious identification with the

                                             108

pain-body, which can and will happen at first, you will be able to quickly rejoin him
in that state. This means that whenever the pain-body temporarily takes over, whether
during menses or at other times, your partner will not mistake it for who you are.
Even if the pain-body attacks him, as it probably will, he will not react to it as if it
were "you," withdraw, or put up some kind of defense. He will hold the space of
intense presence. Nothing else is needed for transformation. At other times, you will
be able to do the same for him or help him reclaim consciousness from the mind by
drawing his attention into the here and now whenever he becomes identified with his
thinking.
In this way, a permanent energy field of a pure and high frequency will arise between
you. No illusion, no pain, no conflict, nothing that is not you, and nothing that is not
love can survive in it. This represents the fulfillment of the divine, transpersonal
purpose of your relationship. It becomes a vortex of consciousness that will draw in
many others.


Give Up The Relationship With Yourself
When one is fully conscious. would one still have a need for a relationship?
Would a man still feel drawn to a woman? Would a woman still feel incomplete
without a man?
Enlightened or not, you are either a man or a woman, so on the level of your form
identity you are not complete. You are one-half of the whole. This incompleteness is
felt as male-female attraction, the pull toward the opposite energy polarity, no matter
how conscious you are. But in that state of inner connectedness, you feel this pull
somewhere on the surface or periphery of your life. Anything that happens to you in
that state feels somewhat like that. The whole world seems like waves or ripples on
the surface of a vast and deep ocean. You are that ocean and. of course, you are also a
ripple, but a ripple that has realized its true identity as the ocean, and compared to
that vastness and depth, the world of waves and ripples is not all that important.
This does not mean that you don't relate deeply to other people or to your partner. In
fact, you can relate deeply only if you are conscious of Being. Coming from Being,
you are able to focus beyond the veil of form. In Being, male and female are one.
Your form may continue to have certain needs, but Being has none. It is already
complete and whole. If those needs are met, that is beautiful, but whether or not they
are met makes no difference to your deep inner state. So it is perfectly possible for an
enlightened person, if the need for the male or female polarity is not met, to feel a
sense of lack or incompleteness on the outer level of his or her being, yet at the same
time be totally complete, fulfilled, and at peace within.

                                            109

In the quest for enlightenment, is being gay a help or a hindrance, or does it not make
any difference?
As you approach adulthood, uncertainty about your sexuality followed by the
realization that you are "different" from others may force you to disidentify from
socially conditioned patterns of thought and behavior. This will automatically raise
your level of consciousness above that of the unconscious majority, whose members
unquestioningly take on board all inherited patterns. In that respect, being gay can be
a help. Being an outsider to some extent, someone who does not "fit in'' with others or
is rejected by them for whatever reason, makes life difficult, but it also places you at
an advantage as far as enlightenment is concerned. It takes you out of
unconsciousness almost by force.
On the other hand, if you then develop a sense of identity based on your gayness, you
have escaped one trap only to fall into another. You will play roles and games
dictated by a mental image you have of yourself as gay. You will become
unconscious. You will become unreal. Underneath your ego mask, you will become
very unhappy. If this happens to you, being gay will have become a hindrance. But
you always get another chance, of course. Acute unhappiness can be a great
awakener.


Is it not true that you need to have a good relationship with yourself and love yourself
before you can have a fulfilling relationship with another person?
If you cannot be at ease with yourself when you are alone, you will seek a
relationship to cover up your unease. You can be sure that the unease will then
reappear in some other form within the relationship, and you will probably hold your
partner responsible for it.
All you really need to do is accept this moment fully. You are then at ease in the here
and now and at ease with yourself.
But do you need to have a relationship with yourself at all? Why can't you just be
yourself? When you have a relationship with yourself, you have split yourself into
two: "I" and "myself," subject and object. That mind-created duality is the root cause
of all unnecessary complexity, of all problems and conflict in your life. In the state of
enlightenment, you are yourself - "you' and "yourself" merge into one. You do not
judge yourself, you do not feel sorry for yourself, you are not proud of yourself, you
do not love yourself, you do not hate yourself, and so on. The split caused by self
reflective consciousness is healed, its curse removed. There is no "self" that you need
to protect, defend, or feed anymore. When you are enlightened, there is one


                                           110

relationship that you no longer have: the relationship with yourself. Once you have
given that up, all your other relationships will be love relationships.

9. BEYOND HAPPINESS AND UNHAPPINESS THERE IS PEACE



The Higher Good Beyond Good And Bad
Is there a difference between happiness and inner peace?
Yes. Happiness depends on conditions being perceived as positive; inner peace does
not.


Is it not possible to attract only positive conditions into our life? If our attitude and
our thinking are always positive, we would manifest only positive events and
situations, wouldn't we?
Do you truly know what is positive and what is negative? Do you have the total
picture? There have been many people for whom limitation, failure, loss, illness, or
pain in whatever form turned out to be their greatest teacher. It taught them to let go
of false self-images and superficial ego-dictated goals and desires. It gave them
depth, humility, and compassion. It made them more real.
Whenever anything negative happens to you, there is a deep lesson concealed within
it, although you may not see it at the time. Even a brief illness or an accident can
show you what is real and unreal in your life, what ultimately matters and what
doesn't.
Seen from a higher perspective, conditions are always positive. To be more precise:
they are neither positive nor negative. They are as they are. And when you live in
complete acceptance of what is - which is the only sane way to live - there is no
"good" or "bad" in your life anymore. There is only a higher good - which includes
the "bad." Seen from the perspective of the mind, however, there is good-bad, like-
dislike, love-hate. Hence, in the Book of Genesis, it is said that Adam and Eve were
no longer allowed to dwell in "paradise" when they "ate of the tree of the knowledge
of good and evil."


This sounds to me like denial and self-deception. When something dreadful happens
to me or someone close to me - accident, illness, pain of some kind or death - I can
pretend that it isn't bad, but the fact remains that it is bad, so why deny it?




                                            112

You are not pretending anything. You are allowing it to be as it is, that's all. This
"allowing to be" takes you beyond the mind with its resistance patterns that create the
positive-negative polarities. It is an essential aspect of forgiveness. Forgiveness of the
present is even more important than forgiveness of the past. If you forgive every
moment - allow it to be as it is - then there will be no accumulation of resentment that
needs to be forgiven at some later time.
Remember that we are not talking about happiness here. For example, when a loved
one has just died, or you feel your own death approaching, you cannot be happy. It is
impossible. But you can be at peace. There may be sadness and tears, but provided
that you have relinquished resistance, underneath the sadness you will feel a deep
serenity, a stillness, a sacred presence. This is the emanation of Being, this is inner
peace, the good that has no opposite.


What if it is a situation that I can do something about? How can I allow it to be and
change it at the same time?
Do what you have to do. In the meantime, accept what is. Since mind and resistance
are synonymous, acceptance immediately frees you from mind dominance and thus
reconnects you with Being. As a result, the usual ego motivations for "doing" - fear,
greed, control, defending or feeding the false sense of self - will cease to operate. An
intelligence much greater than the mind is now in charge, and so a different quality of
consciousness will flow into your doing.
'Accept whatever comes to you woven in the pattern of your destiny, for what could
more aptly fit your needs?" This was written 2,ooo years ago by Marcus Aurelius,
one of those exceedingly rare humans who possessed worldly power as well as
wisdom.
It seems that most people need to experience a great deal of suffering before they will
relinquish resistance and accept - before they will forgive. As soon as they do, one of
the greatest miracles happens: the awakening of Being-consciousness through what
appears as evil, the transmutation of suffering into inner peace. The ultimate effect of
all the evil and suffering in the world is that it will force humans into realizing who
they are beyond name and form. Thus, what we perceive as evil from our limited
perspective is actually part of the higher good that has no opposite. This, however,
does not become true for you except through forgiveness. Until that happens, evil has
not been redeemed and therefore remains evil.
Through forgiveness, which essentially means recognizing the insubstantiality of the
past and allowing the present moment to be as it is, the miracle of transformation


                                            113

happens not only within but also without. A silent space of intense presence arises
both in you and around you. Whoever or whatever enters that field of consciousness
will be affected by it, sometimes visibly and immediately, sometimes at deeper levels
with visible changes appearing at a later time. You dissolve discord, heal pain, dispel
unconsciousness ­ without doing anything - simply by being and holding that
frequency of intense presence.


The End Of Your Life Drama
In that state of acceptance and inner peace, even though you may not call it "bad, "
can anything still come into your life that would be called "bad" from a perspective of
ordinary consciousness?
Most of the so-called bad things that happen in people's lives are due to
unconsciousness. They are self created, or rather ego-created. I sometimes refer to
those things as "drama." When you are fully conscious, drama does not come into
your life anymore. Let me remind you briefly how the ego operates and how it
creates drama.
Ego is the unobserved mind that runs your life when you are not present as the
witnessing consciousness, the watcher. The ego perceives itself as a separate
fragment in a hostile universe, with no real inner connection to any other being,
surrounded by other egos which it either sees as a potential threat or which it will
attempt to use for its own ends. The basic ego patterns are designed to combat its own
deepseated fear and sense of lack. They are resistance, control, power, greed, defense,
attack. Some of the ego's strategies are extremely clever, yet they never truly solve
any of its problems, simply because the ego itself is the problem.
When egos come together, whether in personal relationships or in organizations or
institutions, "bad" things happen sooner or later: drama of one kind or another, in the
form of conflict, problems, power struggles, emotional or physical violence, and so
on. This includes collective evils such as war, genocide, and exploitation - all due to
massed unconsciousness. Furthermore, many types of illness are caused by the ego's
continuous resistance, which creates restrictions and blockages in the flow of energy
through the body. When you reconnect with Being and are no longer run by your
mind, you cease to create those things. You do not create or participate in drama
anymore.
Whenever two or more egos come together, drama of one kind or another ensues. But
even if you live totally alone, you still create your own drama. When you feel sorry
for yourself, that's drama. Whenyou feel guilty or anxious, that's drama. When you
let the past or future obscure the present, you are creating time, psychological time -

                                           114

the stuff out of which drama is made. Whenever you are not honoring the present
moment by allowing it to be, you are creating drama.
Most people are in love with their particular life drama. Their story is their identity.
The ego runs their life. They have their whole sense of self invested in it. Even their -
usually unsuccessful - search for an answer, a solution, or for healing becomes part of
it. What they fear and resist most is the end of their drama. As long as theyare their
mind, what they fear and resist most is their own awakening.
When you live in complete acceptance of what is, that is the end of all drama in your
life. Nobody can even have an argument with you, no matter how hard he or she tries.
You cannot have an argument with a fully conscious person. An argument implies
identification with your mind and a mental position, as well as resistance and reaction
to the other person's position. The result is that the polar opposites become mutually
energized. These are the mechanics of unconsciousness. You can still make your
point clearly and firmly, but there will be no reactive force behind it, no defense or
attack. So it won't turn into drama. When you are fully conscious, you cease to be in
conflict. "No one who is at one with himself can even conceive of conflict," states A
Course in Miracles. This refers not only to conflict with other people but more
fundamentally to conflict within you, which ceases when there is no longer any clash
between the demands and expectations of your mind and what is.


Impermanence And The Cycles Of Life
However, as long as you are in the physical dimension and linked to the collective
human psyche, physical pain - although rare - is still possible. This is not to be
confused with suffering, with mental emotional pain. All suffering is ego-created and
is due to resistance. Also, as long as you are in this dimension, you are still subject to
its cyclical nature and to the law of impermanence of all things, but you no longer
perceive this as "bad" - it just is.
Through allowing the "isness" of all things, a deeper dimension underneath the play
of opposites reveals itself to you as an abiding presence, an unchanging deep
stillness, an uncaused joy beyond good and bad. This is the joy of Being, the peace of
God.
On the level of form, there is birth and death, creation and destruction, growth and
dissolution, of seemingly separate forms. This is reflected everywhere: in the life
cycle of a star or a planet, a physical body, a tree, a flower; in the rise and fall of
nations, political systems, civilizations; and in the inevitable cycles of gain and loss
in the life of an individual.



                                           115

There are cycles of success, when things come to you and thrive, and cycles of
failure, when they wither or disintegrate and you have to let them go in order to make
room for new things to arise, or for transformation to happen. If you cling and resist
at that point, it means you are refusing to go with the flow of life, and you will suffer.
It is not true that the up cycle is good and the down cycle bad, except in the mind's
judgment. Growth is usually considered positive, but nothing can grow forever. If
growth, of whatever kind, were to go on and on, it would eventually become
monstrous and destructive. Dissolution is needed for new growth to happen. One
cannot exist without the other.
The down cycle is absolutely essential for spiritual realization. You must have failed
deeply on some level or experienced some deep loss or pain to be drawn to the
spiritual dimension. Or perhaps your very success became empty and meaningless
and so turned out to be failure. Failure lies concealed in every success, and success in
every failure. In this world, which is to say on the level of form, everybody "fails"
sooner or later, of course, and every achievement eventually comes to naught. All
forms are impermanent.
You can still be active and enjoy manifesting and creating new forms and
circumstances, but you won't be identified with them. You do not need them to give
you a sense of self. They are not your life - only your life situation.
Your physical energy is also subject to cycles. It cannot always be at a peak. There
will be times of low as well as high energy. There will be periods when you are
highly active and creative, but there may also be times when everything seems
stagnant, when it seems that you are not getting anywhere, not achieving anything. A
cycle can last for anything from a few hours to a few years. There are large cycles
and small cycles within these large ones. Many illnesses are created through fighting
against the cycles of low energy, which are vital for regeneration. The compulsion to
do, and the tendency to derive your sense of self worth and identity from external
factors such as achievement, is an inevitable illusion as long as you are identified
with the mind. This makes it hard or impossible for you to accept the low cycles and
allow them to be. Thus, the intelligence of the organism may take over as a self
protective measure and create an illness in order to force you to stop, so that the
necessary regeneration can take place.
The cyclical nature of the universe is closely linked with the impermanence of all
things and situations. The Buddha made this a central part of his teaching. All
conditions are highly unstable and in constant flux, or, as he put it, impermanence is a
characteristic of every condition, every situation you will ever encounter in your life.
It will change, disappear, or no longer satisfy you. Impermanence is also central to

                                            116

Jesus' teaching: "Do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust
consume and where thieves break in and steal...."
As long as a condition is judged as "good" by your mind, whether it be a relationship,
a possession, a social role, a place, or your physical body, the mind attaches itself to
it and identifies with it. It makes you happy, makes you feel good about yourself, and
it may become part of who you are or think you are. But nothing lasts in this dimen-
sion where moth and rust consume. Either it ends or it changes, or it may undergo a
polarity shift: The same condition that was good yesterday or last year has suddenly
or gradually turned into bad. The same condition that made you happy, then makes
you unhappy. The prosperity of today becomes the empty consumerism of tomorrow.
The happy wedding and honeymoon become the unhappy divorce or the unhappy
coexistence. Or a condition disappears, so its absence makes you unhappy. When a
condition or situation that the mind has attached itself to and identified with changes
or disappears, the mind cannot accept it. It will cling to the disappearing condition
and resist the change. It is almost as if a limb were being torn off your body.
We sometimes hear of people who have lost all their money or whose reputation has
been ruined committing suicide. Those are the extreme cases. Others, whenever a
major loss of one kind or another occurs, just become deeply unhappy or make
themselves ill. They cannot distinguish between their life and their life situation. I
recently read about a famous actress who died in her eighties. As her beauty started to
fade and became ravaged by old age, she grew desperately unhappy and became a
recluse. She, too, had identified with a condition: her external appearance. First, the
condition gave her a happy sense of self, then an unhappy one. If she had been able to
connect with the formless and timeless life within, she could have watched and
allowed the fading of her external form from a place of serenity and peace. Moreover,
her external form would have become increasingly transparent to the light shining
through from her ageless true nature, so her beauty would not really have faded but
simply become transformed into spiritual beauty. However, nobody told her that this
is possible. The most essential kind of knowledge is not yet widely accessible.
The Buddha taught that even your happiness is dukkha -a Pali word meaning
"suffering" or "unsatisfactoriness." It is inseparable from its opposite. This means that
your happiness and unhappiness are in fact one. Only the illusion of time separates
them.
This is not being negative. It is simply recognizing the nature of things, so that you
don't pursue an illusion for the rest of your life.
Nor is it saying that you should no longer appreciate pleasant or beautiful things or
conditions. But to seek something through them that they cannot give - an identity, a

                                             117

sense of permanency and fulfillment - is a recipe for frustration and suffering. The
whole advertising industry and consumer society would collapse if people became
enlightened and no longer sought to find their identity through things. The more you
seek happiness in this way, the more it will elude you. Nothing out there will ever
satisfy you except temporarily and superficially, but you may need to experience
many disillusionrnents before you realize that truth. Things and conditions can give
you pleasure, but they will also give you pain. Things and conditions can give you
pleasure, but they cannot give you joy. Nothing can give you joy. Joy is uncaused and
arises from within as the joy of Being. It is an essential part of the inner state of
peace, the state that has been called the peace of God. It is your natural state, not
something that you need to work hard for or struggle to attain.
Many people never realize that there can be no "salvation'' in anything they do,
possess, or attain. Those who do realize it often become world-weary and depressed:
if nothing can give you true fulfillment, what is there left to strive for, what is the
point in anything? The Old Testament prophet must have arrived at such a realization
when he wrote "I have seen everything that is done under the sun, and behold, all is
vanity and a striving after wind." When you reach this point, you are one step away
from despair - and one step away from enlightenment.
A Buddhist monk once told me: 'All I have learned in the twenty years that I have
been a monk I can sum up in one sentence: All that arises passes away. This I know."
What he meant, of course, was this:
I have learned to offer no resistance to what is; I have learned to allow the present
moment to be and to accept the impermanent nature of all things and conditions. Thus
have I found peace.
To offer no resistance to life is to be in a state of grace, ease, and lightness. This state
is then no longer dependent upon things being in a certain way, good or bad. It seems
almost paradoxical, yet when your inner dependency on form is gone, the general
conditions of your life, the outer forms, tend to improve greatly. Things, people, or
conditions that you thought you needed for your happiness now come to you with no
struggle or effort on your part, and you are free to enjoy and appreciate them - while
they last. All those things, of course, will still pass away, cycles will come and go,
but with dependency gone there is no fear of loss anymore. Life flows with ease.
The happiness that is derived from some secondary source is never very deep. It is
only a pale reflection of the joy of Being, the vibrant peace that you find within as
you enter the state of nonresistance. Being takes you beyond the polar opposites of
the mind and frees you from dependency on form. Even if everything were to col-



                                             118

lapse and crumble all around you, you would still feel a deep inner core of peace.
You may not be happy, but you will be at peace.


Using And Relinquishing Negativity
All inner resistance is experienced as negativity in one form or another. All negativity
is resistance. In this context, the two words are almost synonymous. Negativity
ranges from irritation or impatience to fierce anger, from a depressed mood or sullen
resentment to suicidal despair. Sometimes the resistance triggers the emotional pain-
body, in which case even a minor situation may produce intense negativity, such as
anger, depression, or deep grief.
The ego believes that through negativity it can manipulate reality and get what it
wants. It believes that through it, it can attract a desirable condition or dissolve an
undesirable one. A Course in Miracles rightly points out that, whenever you are
unhappy, there is the unconscious belief that the unhappiness "buys" you what you
want. If "you' - the mind - did not believe that unhappiness works, why would you
create it? The fact is, of course, that negativity does not work. Instead of attracting a
desirable condition, it stops it from arising. Instead of dissolving an undesirable one,
it keeps it in place. Its only "useful" function is that it strengthens the ego, and that is
why the ego loves it.
Once you have identified with some form of negativity, you do not want to let go,
and on a deeply unconscious level, you do not want positive change. It would
threaten your identity as a depressed, angry, or hard-done-by person. You will then
ignore, deny or sabotage the positive in your life. This is a common phenomenon. It
is also insane.
Negativity is totally unnatural. It is a psychic pollutant, and there is a deep link
between the poisoning and destruction of nature and the vast negativity that has
accumulated in the collective human psyche. No other life form on the planet knows
negativity, only humans, just as no other life form violates and poisons the Earth that
sustains it. Have you ever seen an unhappy flower or a stressed oak tree? Have you
come across a depressed dolphin, a frog that has a problem with self-esteem, a cat
that cannot relax, or a bird that carries hatred and resentment? The only animals that
may occasionally experience something akin to negativity or show signs of neurotic
behavior are those that live in close contact with humans and so link into the human
mind and its insanity.
Watch any plant or animal and let it teach you acceptance of what is, surrender to the
Now. Let it teach you Being. Let it teach you integrity - which means to be one, to be



                                            119

yourself, to be real. Let it teach you how to live and how to die, and how not to make
living and dying into a problem.
I have lived with several Zen masters - all of them cats. Even ducks have taught me
important spiritual lessons. Just watching them is a meditation. How peacefully they
float along, at ease with themselves, totally present in the Now, dignified and perfect
as only a mindless creature can be. Occasionally, however, two ducks will get into a
fight - sometimes for no apparent reason, or because one duck has strayed into
another's private space. The fight usually lasts only for a few seconds, and then the
ducks separate, swim off in opposite directions, and vigorously flap their wings a few
times. They then continue to swim on peacefully as if the fight had never happened.
When I observed that for the first time, I suddenly realized that by flapping their
wings they were releasing surplus energy, thus preventing it from becoming trapped
in their body and turning into negativity. This is natural wisdom, and it is easy for
them because they do not have a mind that keeps the past alive unnecessarily and
then builds an identity around it.


Couldn't a negative emotion also contain an important message? For example, if I
often feel depressed, it may be a signal that there is something wrong with my life,
and it may force me to look at my life situation and make some changes. So I need to
listen to what the emotion is telling me and not just dismiss it as negative.
Yes, recurring negative emotions do sometimes contain a message, as do illnesses.
But any changes that you make, whether they have to do with your work, your
relationships, or your surroundings, are ultimately only cosmetic unless they arise out
of a change in your level of consciousness. And as far as that is concerned, it can only
mean one thing: becoming more present. When you have reached a certain degree of
presence, you don't need negativity anymore to tell you what is needed in your life
situation. But as long as negativity is there, use it. Use it as a kind of signal that
reminds you to be more present.


How do we stop negativity from arising, and how do we get rid of it once it is there?
As I said, you stop it from arising by being fully present. But don't become
discouraged. There are as yet few people on the planet who can sustain a state of
continuous presence, although some are getting close to it. Soon, I believe, there will
be many more.




                                           120

Whenever you notice that some form of negativity has arisen within you, look on it
not as a failure, but as a helpful signal that is telling you: "Wake up. Get out of your
mind. Be present."
There is a novel by Aldous Huxley called Island, written in his later years when he
became very interested in spiritual teachings. It tells the story of a man shipwrecked
on a remote island cut off from the rest of the world. This island contains a unique
civilization. The unusual thing about it is that its inhabitants, unlike those of the rest
of the world, are actually sane. The first thing that the man notices are the colorful
parrots perched in the trees, and they seem to be constantly croaking the words
"Attention. Here and Now. Attention. Here and Now." We later learn that the
islanders taught them these words in order to be reminded continuously to stay
present.
So whenever you feel negativity arising within you, whether caused by an external
factor, a thought, or even nothing in particular that you are aware of, look on it as a
voice saying `Attention. Here and Now. Wake up." Even the slightest irritation is
significant and needs to be acknowledged and looked at; otherwise, there will be a
cumulative build-up of unobserved reactions. As I said before, you may be able to
just drop it once you realize that you don't want to have this energy field inside you
and that it serves no purpose. But then make sure that you drop it completely. If you
cannot drop it, just accept that it is there and take your attention into the feeling, as I
pointed out earlier.
As an alternative to dropping a negative reaction, you can make it disappear by
imagining yourself becoming transparent to the external cause of the reaction. I
recommend that you practice it with little, even trivial, things first. Let's say that you
are sitting quietly at home. Suddenly, there is the penetrating sound of a car alarm
from across the street. Irritation arises. What is the purpose of the irritation? None
whatsoever. Why did you create it? You didn't. The mind did. It was totally
automatic, totally unconscious. Why did the mind create it? Because it holds the
unconscious belief that its resistance, which you experience as negativity or
unhappiness in some form, will somehow dissolve the undesirable condition. This, of
course, is a delusion. The resistance that it creates, the irritation or anger in this case,
is far more disturbing than the original cause that it is attempting to dissolve.
All this can be transformed into spiritual practice. Feel yourself becoming
transparent, as it were, without the solidity of a material body. Now allow the noise,
or whatever causes a negative reaction, to pass right through you. It is no longer
hitting a solid "wall" inside you. As I said, practice with little things first. The car
alarm, the dog barking, the children screaming, the traffic jam. Instead of having a

                                             121

wall of resistance inside you that gets constantly and painfully hit by things that
"should not be happening," let everything pass through you.
Somebody says something to you that is rude or designed to hurt. Instead of going
into unconscious reaction and negativity, such as attack, defense, or withdrawal, you
let it pass right through you. Offer no resistance. It is as if there is nobody there to get
hurt anymore. That is forgiveness. In this way, you become invulnerable. You can
still tell that person that his or her behavior is unacceptable, if that is what you choose
to do. But that person no longer has the power to control your inner state. You are
then in your power - not in someone else's, nor are you run by your mind. Whether it
is a car alarm, a rude person, a flood, an earthquake, or the loss of all your posses-
sions, the resistance mechanism is the same.


I have been practicing meditation, I have been to workshops, I have read many books
on spirituality, I try to be in a state of nonresistance - but if you ask me whether I
have found true and lasting inner peace, my honest answer would have to be "no."
Why haven't I found it? What else can I do?
You are still seeking outside, and you cannot get out of the seeking mode.
Maybe the next workshop will have the answer, maybe that new technique. To
you I would say. Don't look for peace. Don't look for any other state than the
one you are in now, otherwise, you will set up inner conflict and unconscious
resistance. Forgive yourself for not being at peace. The moment you completely
accept your non-peace, your nonpeace becomes transmuted into peace.
Anything you accept fully will get you there, will take you into peace. This is
the miracle of surrender. You may have heard the phrase "turn the other cheek,"
which a great teacher of enlightenment used 2,000 years ago. He was attempting
to convey symbolically the secret of nonresistance and nonreaction. In this
statement, as in all his others, he was concerned only with your inner reality,
not with the outer conduct of your life.
Do you know the story of Banzan? Before he became a great Zen master, he spent
many years in the pursuit of enlightenment, but it eluded him. Then one day, as he
was walking in the marketplace, he overheard a conversation between a butcher and
his customer. "Give me the best piece of meat you have," said the customer. And the
butcher replied, "Every piece of meat I have is the best. There is no piece of meat
here that is not the best." Upon hearing this, Banzan became enlightened.
I can see you are waiting for some explanation. When you accept what is, every piece
of meat - every moment - is the best. That is enlightenment.



                                             122

The Nature Of Compassion
Having gone beyond the mind-made opposites, you become like a deep lake. The
outer situation of your life and whatever happens there, is the surface of the lake.
Sometimes calm, sometimes windy and rough, according to the cycles and seasons.
Deep down, however, the lake is always undisturbed. You are the whole lake, not just
the surface, and you are in touch with your own depth, which remains absolutely still.
You don't resist change by mentally clinging to any situation. Your inner peace does
not depend on it. You abide in Being - unchanging, timeless, deathless - and you are
no longer dependent for fulfillment or happiness on the outer world of constantly
fluctuating forms. You can enjoy them, play with them, create new forms, appreciate
the beauty of it all. But there will be no need to attach yourself to any of it.


When you become this detached, does it not mean that you also become remote from
other human beings?
On the contrary. As long as you are unaware of Being, the reality of other humans
will elude you, because you have not found your own. Your mind will like or dislike
their form, which is not just their body but includes their mind as well. True
relationship becomes possible only when there is an awareness of Being. Coming
from Being, you will perceive another person's body and mind as just a screen, as it
were, behind which you can feel their true reality, as you feel yours. So, when
confronted with someone else's suffering or unconscious behavior, you stay present
and in touch with Being and are thus able to look beyond the form and feel the other
person's radiant and pure Being through your own. At the level of Being, all suffering
is recognized as an illusion. Suffering is due to identification with form. Miracles of
healing sometimes occur through this realization, by awakening Being-consciousness
in others - if they are ready.


Is that what compassion is?
Yes. Compassion is the awareness of a deep bond between yourself and all creatures.
But there are two sides to compassion, two sides to this bond. On the one hand, since
you are still here as a physical body, you share the vulnerability and mortality of your
physical form with every other human and with every living being. Next time you say
"I have nothing in common with this person," remember that you have a great deal in
common: A few years from now - two years or seventy years, it doesn't make much
difference - both of you will have become rotting corpses, then piles of dust, then
nothing at all. This is a sobering and humbling realization that leaves little room for


                                            123

pride. Is this a negative thought? No, it is a fact. Why close your eyes to it? In that
sense, there is total equality between you and every other creature.
One of the most powerful spiritual practices is to meditate deeply on the mortality of
physical forms, including your own. This is called: Die before you die. Go into it
deeply. Your physical form is dissolving, is no more. Then a moment comes when all
mind-forms or thoughts also die. Yet you are still there - the divine presence that you
are. Radiant, fully awake. Nothing that was real ever died, only names, forms, and
illusions.
The realization of this deathless dimension, your true nature, is the other side of
compassion. On a deep feeling-level, you now recognize not only your own
immortality but through your own that of every other creature as well. On the level of
form, you share mortality and the precariousness of existence. On the level of Being,
you share eternal, radiant life. These are the two aspects of compassion. In com-
passion, the seemingly opposite feelings of sadness and joy merge into one and
become transmuted into a deep inner peace. This is the peace of God. It is one of the
most noble feelings that humans are capable of, and it has great healing and
transformative power. But true compassion, as I have just described it, is as yet rare.
To have deep empathy for the suffering of another being certainly requires a high
degree of consciousness but represents only one side of compassion. It is not
complete. True compassion goes beyond empathy or sympathy. It does not happen
until sadness merges with joy, the joy of Being beyond form, the joy of eternal life.


Toward A Different Order Of Reality
I don't agree that the body needs to die. I am convinced that we can achieve physical
immortality. We believe in death and that's why the body dies.
The body does not die because you believe in death. The body exists, or seems to,
because you believe in death. Body and death are part of the same illusion, created by
the egoic mode of consciousness, which has no awareness of the Source of life and
sees itself as separate and constantly under threat. So it creates the illusion that you
are a body, a dense, physical vehicle that is constantly under threat.
To perceive yourself as a vulnerable body that was born and a little later dies - that's
the illusion. Body and death: one illusion. You cannot have one without the other.
You want to keep one side of the illusion and get rid of the other, but that is
impossible. Either you keep all of it or you relinquish all of it.
However, you cannot escape from the body, nor do you have to. The body is an
incredible misperception of your true nature. But your true nature is concealed



                                           124

somewhere within that illusion, not outside it, so the body is still the only point of
access to it.
If you saw an angel but mistook it for a stone statue, all you would have to do is
adjust your vision and look more closely at the "stone statue," not start looking
somewhere else. You would then find that there never was a stone statue.


If belief in death creates the body, why does an animal have a body? An animal
doesn't have an ego, and it doesn't believe in death....
But it still dies, or seems to.
Remember that your perception of the world is a reflection of your state of
consciousness. You are not separate from it, and there is no objective world out there.
Every moment, your consciousness creates the world that you inhabit. One of the
greatest insights that has come out of modern physics is that of the unity between the
observer and the observed: the person conducting the experiment - the observing
consciousness - cannot be separated from the observed phenomena, and a different
way of looking causes the observed phenomena to behave differently. If you believe,
on a deep level, in separation and the struggle for survival, then you see that belief
reflected all around you and your perceptions are governed by fear. You inhabit a
world of death and of bodies fighting, killing, and devouring each other.
Nothing is what it seems to be. The world that you create and see through the egoic
mind may seem a very imperfect place, even a vale of tears. But whatever you
perceive is only a kind of symbol, like an image in a dream. It is how your
consciousness interprets and interacts with the molecular energy dance of the
universe. This energy is the raw material of so-called physical reality. You see it in
terms of bodies and birth and death, or as a struggle for survival. An infinite number
of completely different interpretations, completely different worlds, is possible and,
in fact, exists - all depending on the perceiving consciousness. Every being is a focal
point of consciousness, and every such focal point creates its own world, although all
those worlds are interconnected. There is a human world, an ant world, a dolphin
world, and so on. There are countless beings whose consciousness frequency is so
different from yours that you are probably unaware of their existence, as they are of
yours. Highly conscious beings who are aware of their connectedness with the Source
and with each other would inhabit a world that to you would appear as a heavenly
realm - and yet all worlds are ultimately one.
Our collective human world is largely created through the level of consciousness we
call mind. Even within the collective human world there are vast differences, many


                                           125

different "sub-worlds," depending on the perceivers or creators of their respective
worlds. Since all worlds are interconnected, when collective human consciousness
becomes transformed, nature and the animal kingdom will reflect that transformation.
Hence the statement in the Bible that in the coming age "The lion shall lie down with
the lamb." This points to the possibility of a completely different order of reality.
The world as it appears to us now is, as I said, largely a reflection of the egoic mind.
Fear being an unavoidable consequence of egoic delusion, it is a world dominated by
fear. Just as the images in a dream are symbols of inner states and feelings, so our
collective reality is largely a symbolic expression of fear and of the heavy layers of
negativity that have accumulated in the collective human psyche. We are not separate
from our world, so when the majority of humans become free of egoic delusion, this
inner change will affect all of creation. You will literally inhabit a new world. It is a
shift in planetary consciousness. The strange Buddhist saying that every tree and
every blade of grass will eventually become enlightened points to the same truth.
According to St. Paul, the whole of creation is waiting for humans to become
enlightened. That is how 1 interpret his saying that "The created universe is waiting
with eager expectation for God's sons to be revealed." St. Paul goes on to say that all
of creation will become redeemed through this: "Up to the present... the whole cre-
ated universe in all its parts groans as if in the pangs of childbirth."
What is being born is a new consciousness and, as its inevitable reflection, a new
world. This is also foretold in the New Testament Book of Revelation: "Then I saw a
new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away."
But don't confuse cause and effect. Your primary task is not to seek salvation through
creating a better world, but to awaken out of identification with form. You are then
no longer bound to this world, this level of reality. You can feel your roots in the
Unmanifested and so are free of attachment to the manifested world. You can still
enjoy the passing pleasures of this world, but there is no fear of loss anymore, so you
don't need to cling to them. Although you can enjoy sensory pleasures, the craving
for sensory experience is gone, as is the constant search for fulfillment through
psychological gratification, through feeding the ego. You are in touch with something
infinitely greater than any pleasure, greater than any manifested thing.
In a way, you then don't need the world anymore. You don't even need it to be
different from the way it is.
It is only at this point that you begin to make a real contribution toward bringing
about a better world, toward creating a different order of reality. It is only at this
point that you are able to feel true compassion and to help others at the level of cause.
Only those who have transcended the world can bring about a better world.

                                             126

You may remember that we talked about the dual nature of true compassion, which is
awareness of a common bond of shared mortality and immortality. At this deep level,
compassion becomes healing in the widest sense. In that state, your healing influence
is primarily based not on doing but on being. Everybody you come in contact with
will be touched by your presence and affected by the peace that you emanate,
whether they are conscious of it or not. When you are fully present and people around
you manifest unconscious behavior, you won't feel the need to react to it, so you don't
give it any reality. Your peace is so vast and deep that anything that is not peace dis-
appears into it as if it had never existed. This breaks the karmic cycle of action and
reaction. Animals, trees, flowers will feel your peace and respond to it. You teach
through being, through demonstrating the peace of God. You become the "light of the
world," an emanation of pure consciousness, and so you eliminate suffering on the
level of cause. You eliminate unconsciousness from the world.
This doesn't mean that you may not also teach through doing - for example, by
pointing out how to disidentify from the mind, recognize unconscious patterns within
oneself, and so on. But who you are is always a more vital teaching and a more
powerful transformer of the world than what you say, and more essential even than
what you do. Furthermore, to recognize the primacy of Being, and thus work on the
level of cause, does not exclude the possibility that your compassion may
simultaneously manifest on the level of doing and of effect, by alleviating suffering
whenever you come across it. When a hungry person asks you for bread and you have
some, you will give it. But as you give the bread, even though your interaction may
only be very brief, what really matters is this moment of shared Being, of which the
bread is only a symbol. A deep healing takes place within it. In that moment, there is
no giver, no receiver.


But there shouldn't be any hunger and starvation in the first place. How can we
create a better world without tackling evils such as hunger and violence first?
All evils are the effect of unconsciousness. You can alleviate the effects of
unconsciousness, but you cannot eliminate them unless you eliminate their cause.
True change happens within, not without.
If you feel called upon to alleviate suffering in the world, that is a very noble thing to
do, but remember not to focus exclusively on the outer; otherwise, you will encounter
frustration and despair. Without a profound change in human consciousness, the
world's suffering is a bottomless pit. So don't let your compassion become one-sided.
Empathy with someone else's pain or lack and a desire to help need to be balanced
with a deeper realization of the eternal nature of all life and the ultimate illusion of all

                                            127

pain. Then let your peace flow into whatever you do and you will be working on the
levels of effect and cause simultaneously.
This also applies if you are supporting a movement designed to stop deeply
unconscious humans from destroying themselves, each other, and the planet, or from
continuing to inflict dreadful suffering on other sentient beings. Remember: Just as
you cannot fight the darkness, so you cannot fight unconsciousness. If you try to do
so, the polar opposites will become strengthened and more deeply entrenched. You
will become identified with one of the polarities, you will create an "enemy," and so
be drawn into unconsciousness yourself. Raise awareness by disseminating
information, or at the most, practice passive resistance. But make sure that you carry
no resistance within, no hatred, no negativity. "Love your enemies," said Jesus,
which, of course, means "have no enemies."
Once you get involved in working on the level of effect, it is all too easy to lose
yourself in it. Stay alert and very, very present. The causal level needs to remain your
primary focus, the teaching of enlightenment your main purpose, and peace your
most precious gift to the world.

10. THE MEANING OF SURRENDER



Acceptance Of The Now
You mentioned "surrender" a few times. I don't like that idea. It sounds somewhat
fatalistic. If we always accept the way things are, we are not going to make any effort
to improve them. It seems to me what progress is all about, both in our personal lives
and collectively, is not to accept the limitations of the present but to strive to go
beyond them and create something better. If we hadn't done this, we would still be
living in caves. How do you reconcile surrender with changing things and getting
things done?
To some people, surrender may have negative connotations, implying defeat, giving
up, failing to rise to the challenges of life, becoming lethargic, and so on. True
surrender, however, is something entirely different. It does not mean to passively put
up with whatever situation you find yourself in and to do nothing about it. Nor does it
mean to cease making plans or initiating positive action.
Surrender is the simple but profound wisdom of yielding to rather than opposing the
flow of life. The only place where you can experience the flow of life is the Now, so
to surrender is to accept the present moment unconditionally and without reservation.
It is to relinquish inner resistance to what is. Inner resistance is to say "no" to what is,
through mental judgment and emotional negativity. It becomes particularly
pronounced when things "go wrong," which means that there is a gap between the
demands or rigid expectations of your mind and what is. That is the pain gap. If you
have lived long enough, you will know that things "go wrong" quite often. It is pre-
cisely at those times that surrender needs to be practiced if you want to eliminate pain
and sorrow from your life. Acceptance of what is immediately frees you from mind
identification and thus reconnects you with Being. Resistance is the mind.
Surrender is a purely inner phenomenon. It does not mean that on the outer level you
cannot take action and change the situation. In fact, it is not the overall situation that
you need to accept when you surrender, but just the tiny segment called the Now.
For example, if you were stuck in the mud somewhere, you wouldn't say: "Okay, I
resign myself to being stuck in the mud." Resignation is not surrender. You don't
need to accept an undesirable or unpleasant life situation. Nor do you need to deceive
yourself and say that there is nothing wrong with being stuck in the mud. No. You


                                            129

recognize fully that you want to get out of it. You then narrow your attention down to
the present moment without mentally labeling it in any way. This means that there is
no judgment of the Now. Therefore, there is no resistance, no emotional negativity.
You accept the "isness" of this moment. Then you take action and do all that you can
to get out of the mud. Such action I call positive action. It is far more effective than
negative action, which arises out of anger, despair, or frustration. Until you achieve
the desired result, you continue to practice surrender by refraining from labeling the
Now.
Let me give you a visual analogy to illustrate the point I am malting. You are walking
along a path at night, surrounded by a thick fog. But you have a powerful flashlight
that cuts through the fog and creates a narrow, clear space in front of you. The fog is
your life situation, which includes past and future; the flashlight is your conscious
presence; the clear space is the Now.
Non-surrender hardens your psychological form, the shell of the ego, and so creates a
strong sense of separateness. The world around you and people in particular come to
be perceived as threatening. The unconscious compulsion to destroy others through
judgment arises, as does the need to compete and dominate. Even nature becomes
yourenemy and your perceptions and interpretations are governed by fear. The mental
disease that we call paranoia is only a slightly more acute form of this normal but
dysfunctional state of consciousness.
Not only your psychological form but also your physical form - your body - becomes
hard and rigid through resistance. Tension arises in different parts of the body, and
the body as a whole contracts. The free flow of life energy through the body, which is
essential for its healthy functioning, is greatly restricted. Bodywork and certain forms
of physical therapy can be helpful in restoring this flow, but unless you practice
surrender in your everyday life, those things can only give temporary symptom relief
since the cause - the resistance pattern - has not been dissolved.
There is something within you that remains unaffected by the transient circumstances
that make up your life situation, and only through surrender do you have access to it.
It is your life, your very Being - which exists eternally in the timeless realm of the
present. Finding this life is "the one thing that is needed" that Jesus talked about.
If you find your life situation unsatisfactory or even intolerable, it is only by
surrendering first that you can break the unconscious resistance pattern that
perpetuates that situation.
Surrender is perfectly compatible with taking action, initiating change or achieving
goals. But in the surrendered state a totally different energy, a different quality, flows
into your doing. Surrender reconnects you with the source-energy of Being, and if

                                            130

your doing is infused with Being, it becomes a joyful celebration of life energy that
takes you more deeply into the Now. Through nonresistance, the quality of your
consciousness and, therefore, the quality of whatever you are doing or creating is
enhanced immeasurably. The results will then look after themselves and reflect that
quality. We could call this "surrendered action." It is not work as we have known it
for thousands of years. As more humans awaken, the word work is going to disappear
from our vocabulary, and perhaps a new word will be created to replace it.
It is the quality of your consciousness at this moment that is the main determinant of
what kind of future you will experience, so to surrender is the most important thing
you can do to bring about positive change. Any action you take is secondary. No truly
positive action can arise out of an unsurrendered state of consciousness.


I can see that if I am in a situation that is unpleasant or unsatisfactory and I
completely accept the moment as it is, there will be no suffering or unhappiness. I
will have risen above it. But I still can't quite see where the energy or motivation for
taking action and bringing about change would come from if there isn't a certain
amount of dissatisfaction.
In the state of surrender, you see very clearly what needs to be done, and you take
action, doing one thing at a time and focusing on one thing at a time. Learn from
nature: See how everything gets accomplished and how the miracle of life unfolds
without dissatisfaction or unhappiness. That's why Jesus said: "Look at the lilies, how
they grow; they neither toil nor spin."
If your overall situation is unsatisfactory or unpleasant, separate out this instant and
surrender to what is. That's the flashlight cutting through the fog. Your state of
consciousness then ceases to be controlled by external conditions. You are no longer
coming from reaction and resistance.
Then look at the specifics of the situation. Ask yourself, "Is there anything I can do to
change the situation, improve it, or remove myself from it?" If so, you take
appropriate action. Focus not on the 100 things that you will or may have to do at
some future time but on the one thing that you can do now. This doesn't mean you
should not do any planning. It may well be that planning is the one thing you can do
now. But make sure you don't start to run "mental movies," project yourself into the
future, and so lose the Now. Any action you take may not bear fruit immediately.
Until it does - do not resist what is. If there is no action you can take, and you cannot
remove yourself from the situation either, then use the situation to make you go more
deeply into surrender, more deeply into the Now, more deeply into Being. When you
enter this timeless dimension of the present, change often comes about in strange

                                             131

ways without the need for a great deal of doing on your part. Life becomes helpful
and cooperative. If inner factors such as fear, guilt, or inertia prevented you from
taking action, they will dissolve in the light of your conscious presence.
Do not confuse surrender with an attitude of "I can't be bothered anymore" or "I just
don't care anymore." If you look at it closely, you will find that such an attitude is
tainted with negativity in the form of hidden resentment and so is not surrender at all
but masked resistance. As you surrender, direct your attention inward to check if
there is any trace of resistance left inside you. Be very alert when you do so;
otherwise, a pocket of resistance may continue to hide in some dark corner in the
form of a thought or an unacknowledged emotion.


From Mind Energy To Spiritual Energy
Letting go of resistance is easier said than done. I still don't see clearly how to let go.
If you say it is by surrendering, the question remains: "How?"
Start by acknowledging that there is resistance. Be there when it happens, when the
resistance arises. Observe how your mind creates it, how it labels the situation,
yourself, or others. Look at the thought process involved. Feel the energy of the
emotion. By witnessing the resistance, you will see that it serves no purpose. By
focusing all your attention on the Now, the unconscious resistance is made conscious,
and that is the end of it. You cannot be conscious and unhappy, conscious and in
negativity. Negativity, unhappiness, or suffering in whatever form means that there is
resistance, and resistance is always unconscious.


Surely I can be conscious of my unhappy feelings?
Would you choose unhappiness? If you did not choose it, how did it arise? What is its
purpose? Who is keeping it alive? You say that you are conscious of your unhappy
feelings, but the truth is that you are identified with them and keep the process alive
through compulsive thinking. All that is unconscious. If you were conscious, that is
to say totally present in the Now, all negativity would dissolve almost instantly. It
could not survive in your presence. It can only survive in your absence. Even the
pain-body cannot survive for long in your presence. You keep your unhappiness alive
by giving it time. That is its lifeblood. Remove time through intense present-moment
awareness and it dies. But do you want it to die? Have you truly had enough? Who
would you be without it?
Until you practice surrender, the spiritual dimension is something you read about,
talk about, get excited about, write books about, think about, believe in - or don't, as


                                            132

the case may be. It makes no difference. Not until you surrender does it become a
living reality in your life. When you do, the energy that you emanate and which then
runs your life is of a much higher vibrational frequency than the mind energy that still
runs our world - the energy that created the existing social, political, and economic
structures of our civilization, and which also continuously perpetuates itself through
our educational systems and the media. Through surrender, spiritual energy comes
into this world. It creates no suffering for yourself, for other humans, or any other life
form on the planet. Unlike mind energy, it does not pollute the earth, and it is not
subject to the law of polarities, which dictates that nothing can exist without its
opposite, that there can be no good without bad. Those who run on mind energy,
which is still the vast majority of the Earths population, remain unaware of the
existence of spiritual energy. It belongs to a different order of reality and will create a
different world when a sufficient number of humans enter the surrendered state and
so become totally free of negativity. If the Earth is to survive, this will be the energy
of those who inhabit it.
Jesus referred to this energy when he made his famous prophetic statement in the
Sermon on the Mount: "Blessed are the gentle; they shall have the earth for their
possession." It is a silent but intense presence that dissolves the unconscious patterns
of the mind. They may still remain active for a while, but they won't run your life
anymore. The external conditions that were being resisted also tend to shift or
dissolve quickly through surrender. It is a powerful transformer of situations and
people. If conditions do not shift immediately, your acceptance of the Now enables
you to rise above them. Either way, you are free.


Surrender In Personal Relationships
What about people who want to use me, manipulate or control me? Am I to surrender
to them?
They are cut off from Being, so they unconsciously attempt to get energy and power
from you. It is true that only an unconscious person will try to use or manipulate
others, but it is equally true that only an unconscious person can be used and
manipulated. If you resist or fight unconscious behavior in others, you become
unconscious yourself. But surrender doesn't mean that you allow yourself to be used
by unconscious people. Not at all. It is perfectly possible to say "no" firmly and
clearly to a person or to walk away from a situation and be in a state of complete
inner nonresistance at the same time. When you say "no" to a person or a situation, let
it come not from reaction but from insight, from a clear realization of what is right or



                                            133

not right for you at that moment. Let it be a nonreactive "no," a high-quality "no," a
"no" that is free of all negativity and so creates no further suffering.


I am in a situation at work that is unpleasant. I have tried to surrender to it, but I find
it impossible. A lot of resistance keeps coming up.
If you cannot surrender, take action immediately. Speak up or do something to bring
about a change in the situation - or remove yourself from it. Take responsibility for
your life. Do not pollute your beautiful, radiant inner Being nor the Earth with
negativity. Do not give unhappiness in any form whatsoever a dwelling place inside
you.
If you cannot take action, for example if you are in prison, then you have two choices
left: resistance or surrender. Bondage or inner freedom from external conditions.
Suffering or inner peace.


Is nonresistance also to be practiced in the external conduct of our lives, such as
nonresistance to violence, or is it something that just concerns our inner life?
You only need to be concerned with the inner aspect. That is primary. Of course, that
will also transform the conduct of your outer life, your relationships, and so on.
Your relationships will be changed profoundly by surrender. If you can never accept
what is, by implication you will not be able to accept anybody the way they are. You
will judge, criticize, label, reject, or attempt to change people. Furthermore, if you
continuously make the Now into a means to an end in the future, you will also make
every person you encounter or relate with into a means to an end. The relationship -
the human being - is then of secondary importance to you, or of no importance at all.
What you can get out of the relationship is primary - be it material gain, a sense of
power, physical pleasure, or some form of ego gratification.
Let me illustrate how surrender can work in relationships. When you become
involved in an argument or some conflict situation, perhaps with a partner or
someone close to you, start by observing how defensive you become as your own
position is attacked, or feel the force of your own aggression as you attack the other
person's position. Observe the attachment to your views and opinions. Feel the
mental-emotional energy behind your need to be right and make the other person
wrong. That's the energy of the egoic mind. You make it conscious by acknowledging
it, by feeling it as fully as possible. Then one day, in the middle of an argument, you
will suddenly realize that you have a choice, and you may decide to drop your own
reaction - just to see what happens. You surrender. I don't mean dropping the reaction


                                             134

just verbally by saying "Okay, you are right," with a look on your face that says, "I
am above all this childish unconsciousness." That's just displacing the resistance to
another level, with the egoic mind still in charge, claiming superiority. I am speaking
of letting go of the entire mental-emotional energy field inside you that was fighting
for power.
The ego is cunning, so you have to be very alert, very present, and totally honest with
yourself to see whether you have truly relinquished your identification with a mental
position and so freed yourself from your mind. If you suddenly feel very light, clear
and deeply at peace, that is an unmistakable sign that you have truly surrendered.
Then observe what happens to the other person's mental position as you no longer
energize it through resistance. When identification with mental positions is out of the
way, true communication begins.


What about nonresistance in the face of violence, aggression, and the like?
Nonresistance doesn't necessarily mean doing nothing. All it means is that any
"doing" becomes nonreactive. Remember the deep wisdom underlying the practice of
Eastern martial arts: don't resist the opponent's force. Yield to overcome.
Having said that, "doing nothing" when you are in a state of intense presence is a
very powerful transformer and healer of situations and people. In Taoism, there is a
term called wuwei, which is usually translated as "actionless activity' or "sitting
quietly doing nothing." In ancient China, this was regarded as one of the highest
achievements or virtues. It is radically different from inactivity in the ordinary state
of consciousness, or rather unconsciousness, which stems from fear, inertia, or
indecision. The real "doing nothing" implies inner nonresistance and intense
alertness.
On the other hand, if action is required, you will no longer react from your
conditioned mind, but you will respond to the situation out of your conscious
presence. In that state, your mind is free of concepts, including the concept of
nonviolence. So who can predict what you will do?
The ego believes that in your resistance lies your strength, whereas in truth resistance
cuts you off from Being, the only place of true power. Resistance is weakness and
fear masquerading as strength. What the ego sees as weakness is your Being in its
purity, innocence, and power. What it sees as strength is weakness. So the ego exists
in a continuous resistance-mode and plays counterfeit roles to cover up your
"weakness," which in truth is your power.




                                           135

Until there is surrender, unconscious role-playing constitutes a large part of human
interaction. In surrender, you no longer need ego defenses and false masks. You
become very simple, very real. "That's dangerous," says the ego. "You'll get hurt.
You'll become vulnerable." What the ego doesn't know, of course, is that only
through the letting go of resistance, through becoming "vulnerable," can you discover
your true and essential invulnerability.


Transforming Illness Into Enlightenment
If someone is seriously ill and completely accepts their condition and surrenders to
the illness, would they not have given up their will to get back to health? The
determination to fight the illness would not be there any more, would it?
Surrender is inner acceptance of what is without any reservations. We are talking
about your life - this instant - not the conditions or circumstances of your life, not
what I call your life situation. We have spoken about this already.
With regard to illness, this is what it means. Illness is part of your life situation. As
such, it has a past and a future. Past and future form an uninterrupted continuum,
unless the redeeming power of the Now is activated through your conscious presence.
As you know, underneath the various conditions that make up your life situation,
which exists in time, there is something deeper, more essential: your Life, your very
Being in the timeless Now.
As there are no problems in the Now, there is no illness either. The belief in a label
that someone attaches to your condition keeps the condition in place, empowers it,
and makes a seemingly solid reality out of a temporary imbalance. It gives it not only
reality and solidity but also a continuity in time that it did not have before. By
focusing on this instant and refraining from labeling it mentally, illness is reduced to
one or several of these factors: physical pain, weakness, discomfort, or disability.
That is what you surrender to - now. You do not surrender to the idea of "illness."
Allow the suffering to force you into the present moment, into a state of intense
conscious presence. Use it for enlightenment.
Surrender does not transform what is, at least not directly. Surrender transforms you.
When you are transformed, your whole world is transformed, because the world is
only a reflection. We spoke about this earlier.
If you looked in the mirror and did not like what you saw, you would have to be mad
to attack the image in the mirror. That is precisely what you do when you are in a
state of nonacceptance. And, of course, if you attack the image, it attacks you back. If
you accept the image, no matter what it is, if you become friendly toward it, it cannot
not become friendly toward you. This is how you change the world.

                                           136

Illness is not the problem. You are the problem - as long as the egoic mind is in
control. When you are ill or disabled, do not feel that you have failed in some way,
do not feel guilty. Do not blame life for treating you unfairly, but do not blame
yourself either. All that is resistance. If you have a major illness, use it for
enlightenment.
Anything "bad" that happens in your life - use it for enlightenment. Withdraw time
from the illness. Do not give it any past or future. Let it force you into intense
present-moment awareness - and see what happens.
Become an alchemist. Transmute base metal into gold, suffering into consciousness,
disaster into enlightenment.
Are you seriously ill and feeling angry now about what I have just said? Then that is
a clear sign that the illness has become part of your sense of self and that you are now
protecting your identity - as well as protecting the illness. The condition that is
labeled "illness" has nothing to do with who you truly are.


When Disaster Strikes
As far as the still unconscious majority of the population is concerned, only a critical
limit-situation has the potential to crack the hard shell of the ego and force them into
surrender and so into the awakened state. A limit-situation arises when through some
disaster, drastic upheaval, deep loss, or suffering your whole world is shattered and
doesn't make sense anymore. It is an encounter with death, be it physical or
psychological. The egoic mind, the creator of this world, collapses. Out of the ashes
of the old world, a new world can then come into being.
There is no guarantee, of course, that even a limit-situation will do it, but the
potential is always there. Some people's resistance to what is even intensifies in such
a situation, and so it becomes a descent into hell. In others, there may only be partial
surrender, but even that will give them a certain depth and serenity that were not there
before. Parts of the ego shell break off, and this allows small amounts of the radiance
and peace that lie beyond the mind to shine through.
Limit-situations have produced many miracles. There have been murderers in death
row waiting for execution who, in the last few hours of their lives, experienced the
egoless state and the deep joy and peace that come with it. The inner resistance to the
situation they found themselves in became so intense as to produce unbearable suf-
fering, and there was nowhere to run and nothing to do to escape it, not even a mind-
projected future. So they were forced into complete acceptance of the unacceptable.
They were forced into surrender. In this way, they were able to enter the state of
grace with which comes redemption: complete release from the past. Of course, it is

                                            137

not really the limit-situation that makes room for the miracle of grace and redemption
but the act of surrender.
So whenever any kind of disaster strikes, or something goes seriously "wrong" -
illness, disability, loss of home or fortune or of a socially defined identity, break-up
of a close relationship, death or suffering of a loved one, or your own impending
death - know that there is another side to it, that you are just one step away from
something incredible: a complete alchemical transmutation of the base metal of pain
and suffering into gold. That one step is called surrender.
I do not mean to say that you will become happy in such a situation. You will not.
But fear and pain will become transmuted into an inner peace and serenity that come
from a very deep place - from the Unmanifested itself. It is "the peace of God, which
passes all understanding." Compared to that, happiness is quite a shallow thing. With
this radiant peace comes the realization - not on the level of mind but within the
depth of your Being - that you are indestructible, immortal. This is not a belief: It is
absolute certainty that needs no external evidence or proof from some secondary
source.


Transforming Suffering Into Peace
I read about a stoic philosopher in ancient Greece who, when he was told that his son
had died in an accident, replied, "I knew he was not immortal." Is that surrender? If
it is, I don't want it. There are some situations in which surrender seems unnatural
and inhuman.
Being cut off from your feelings is not surrender. But we don't know what his inner
state was when he said those words. In certain extreme situations, it may still be
impossible for you to accept theNow. But you always get a second chance at
surrender.
Your first chance is to surrender each moment to the reality of that moment. Knowing
that what is cannot be undone - because it already is - you say yes to what is or accept
what isn't. Then you do what you have to do, whatever the situation requires. If you
abide in this state of acceptance, you create no more negativity, no more suffering, no
more unhappiness. You then live in a state of nonresistance, a state of grace and
lightness, free of struggle.
Whenever you are unable to do that, whenever you miss that chance - either because
you are not generating enough conscious presence to prevent some habitual and
unconscious resistance pattern from arising, or because the condition is so extreme as
to be absolutely unacceptable to you - then you are creating some form of pain, some



                                           138

form of suffering. It may look as if the situation is creating the suffering, but
ultimately this is not so - your resistance is.
Now here is your second chance at surrender: If you cannot accept what is outside,
then accept what is inside. If you cannot accept the external condition, accept the
internal condition. This means: Do not resist the pain. Allow it to be there. Surrender
to the grief, despair, fear, loneliness, or whatever form the suffering takes. Witness it
without labeling it mentally. Embrace it. Then see how the miracle of surrender
transmutes deep suffering into deep peace. This is your crucifixion. Let it become
your resurrection and ascension.


I do not see how one can surrender to suffering. As you yourself pointed out,
suffering is non-surrender. How could you surrender to nonsurrender?
Forget about surrender for a moment. When your pain is deep, all talk of surrender
will probably seem futile and meaningless anyway. When your pain is deep, you will
likely have a strong urge to escape from it rather than surrender to it. You don't want
to feel what you feel. What could be more normal? But there is no escape, no way
out. There are many pseudo escapes - work, drink, drugs, anger, projection,
suppression, and so on - but they don't free you from the pain. Suffering does not
diminish in intensity when you make it unconscious. When you deny emotional pain,
everything you do or think as well as your relationships become contaminated with it.
You broadcast it, so to speak, as the energy you emanate, and others will pick it up
subliminally. If they are unconscious, they may even feel compelled to attack or hurt
you in some way, or you may hurt them in an unconscious projection of your pain.
You attract and manifest whatever corresponds to your inner state.
When there is no way out, there is still always a way through. So don't turn away
from the pain. Face it. Feel it fully. Feel it - don't think about it! Express it if
necessary, but don't create a script in your mind around it. Give all your attention to
the feeling, not to the person, event, or situation that seems to have caused it. Don't
let the mind use the pain to create a victim identity for yourself out of it. Feeling
sorry for yourself and telling others your story will keep you stuck in suffering. Since
it is impossible to get away from the feeling, the only possibility of change is to move
into it; otherwise, nothing will shift. So give your complete attention to what you feel,
and refrain from mentally labeling it. As you go into the feeling, be intensely alert. At
first, it may seem like a dark and terrifying place, and when the urge to turn away
from it comes, observe it but don't act on it. Keep putting your attention on the pain,
keep feeling the grief, the fear, the dread, the loneliness, whatever it is. Stay alert,
stay present - present with your whole Being, with every cell of your body. As you do

                                             139

so, you are bringing a light into this darkness. This is the flame of your
consciousness.
At this stage, you don' t need to be concerned with surrender anymore. It has
happened already. How? Full attention is full acceptance, is surrender. By giving full
attention, you use the power of the Now, which is the power of your presence. No
hidden pocket of resistance can survive in it. Presence removes time. Without time,
no suffering, no negativity, can survive.
The acceptance of suffering is a journey into death. Facing deep pain, allowing it to
be, taking your attention into it, is to enter death consciously. When you have died
this death, you realize that there is no death - and there is nothing to fear. Only the
ego dies. Imagine a ray of sunlight that has forgotten it is an inseparable part of the
sun and deludes itself into believing it has to fight for survival and create and cling to
an identity other than the sun. Would the death of this delusion not be incredibly
liberating?
Do you want an easy death? Would you rather die without pain, without agony? Then
die to the past every moment, and let the light of your presence shine away the heavy,
time-bound self you thought of as "you."


The Way Of The Cross
There are many accounts of people who say they have found God through their deep
suffering, and there is the Christian expression "the way of the cross," which I
suppose points to the same thing.
We are concerned with nothing else here.
Strictly speaking, they did not find God through their suffering, because suffering
implies resistance. They found God through surrender, through total acceptance of
what is, into which they were forced by their intense suffering. They must have
realized on some level that their pain was self-created.


How do you equate surrender with finding God?
Since resistance is inseparable from the mind, relinquishment of resistance -
surrender - is the end of the mind as your master, the impostor pretending to be
"you," the false god. All judgment and all negativity dissolve. The realm of Being,
which had been obscured by the mind, then opens up. Suddenly, a great stillness
arises within you, an unfathomable sense of peace. And within that peace, there is
great joy. And within that joy, there is love. And at the innermost core, there is the
sacred, the immeasurable, That which cannot be named.


                                           140

I don't call it finding God, because how can you find that which was never lost, the
very life that you are? The word God is limiting not only because of thousands of
years of misperception and misuse, but also because it implies an entity other than
you. God is Being itself, not a being. There can be no subject-object relationship
here, no duality, no you and God. God-realization is the most natural thing there is.
The amazing and incomprehensible fact is not that you can become conscious of God
but that you are not conscious of God.
The way of the cross that you mentioned is the old way to enlightenment, and until
recently it was the only way. But don't dismiss it or underestimate its efficacy. It still
works.
The way of the cross is a complete reversal. It means that the worst thing in your life,
your cross, turns into the best thing that ever happened to you, by forcing you into
surrender, into "death," forcing you to become as nothing, to become as God -
because God, too, is no-thing.
At this time, as far as the unconscious majority of humans is concerned, the way of
the cross is still the only way. They will only awaken through further suffering, and
enlightenment as a collective phenomenon will be predictably preceded by vast
upheavals. This process reflects the workings of certain universal laws that govern
the growth of consciousness and thus was foreseen by some seers. It is described,
among other places, in the Book of Revelation or Apocalypse, though cloaked in
obscure and sometimes impenetrable symbology. This suffering is inflicted not by
God but by humans on themselves and on each other as well as by certain defensive
measures that the Earth, which is a living, intelligent organism, is going to take to
protect herself from the onslaught of human madness.
However, there is a growing number of humans alive today whose consciousness is
sufficiently evolved not to need any more suffering before the realization of
enlightenment. You may be one of them.
Enlightenment through suffering - the way of the cross - means to be forced into the
kingdom of heaven kicking and screaming. You finally surrender because you can' t
stand the pain anymore, but the pain could go on for a long time until this happens.
Enlightenment consciously chosen means to relinquish your attachment to past and
future and to make the Now the main focus of your life. It means choosing to dwell in
the state of presence rather than in time. It means saying yes to what is. You then
don't need pain anymore. How much more time do you think you will need before
you are able to say "I will create no more pain, no more suffering?" How much more
pain do you need before you can make that choice?



                                          141

If you think that you need more time, you will get more time - and more pain. Time
and pain are inseparable.


The Power To Choose
What about all those people who, it seems, actually want to suffer? I have a friend
whose partner is physically abusive toward her, and her previous relationship was of
a similar kind. Why does she choose such men, and why is she refusing to get out of
that situation now? Why do so many people actually choose pain?
I know that the word choose is a favorite New Age term, but it isn't entirely accurate
in this context. It is misleading to say that somebody "chose" a dysfunctional
relationship or any other negative situation in his or her life. Choice implies
consciousness - a high degree of consciousness. Without it, you have no choice.
Choice begins the moment you disidentify from the mind and its conditioned
patterns, the moment you become present. Until you reach that point, you are
unconscious, spiritually speaking. This means that you are compelled to think, feel,
and act in certain ways according to the conditioning of your mind. That is why Jesus
said: "Forgive them, for they know not what they do." This is not related to
intelligence in the conventional sense of the word. I have met many highly intelligent
and educated people who were also completely unconscious, which is to say com-
pletely identified with their mind. In fact, if mental development and increased
knowledge are not counterbalanced by a corresponding growth in consciousness, the
potential for unhappiness and disaster is very great.
Your friend is stuck in a relationship with an abusive partner, and not for the first
time. Why? No choice. The mind, conditioned as it is by the past, always seeks to re-
create what it knows and is familiar with. Even if it is painful, at least it is familiar.
The mind always adheres to the known. The unknown is dangerous because it has no
control over it. That's why the mind dislikes and ignores the present moment. Present-
moment awareness creates a gap not only in the stream of mind but also in the past-
future continuum. Nothing truly new and creative can come into this world except
through that gap, that clear space of infinite possibility.
So your friend, being identified with her mind, may be re-creating a pattern learned in
the past in which intimacy and abuse are inseparably linked. Alternatively, she may
be acting out a mind pattern learned in early childhood according to which she is
unworthy and deserves to be punished. It is possible, too, that she lives a large part of
her life through the pain-body, which always seeks more pain on which to feed. Her
partner has his own unconscious patterns, which complement hers. Of course her
situation is self created, but who or what is the self that is doing the creating? A

                                            142

mental-emotional pattern from the past, no more. Why make a self out of it? If you
tell her that she has chosen her condition or situation, you are reinforcing her state of
mind identification. But is her mind pattern who she is? Is it her self? Is her true
identity derived from the past? Show your friend how to be the observing presence
behind her thoughts and her emotions. Tell her about the pain-body and how to free
herself from it. Teach her the art of inner-body awareness. Demonstrate to her the
meaning of presence. As soon as she is able to access the power of the Now, and
thereby break through her conditioned past, she will have a choice.
Nobody chooses dysfunction, conflict, pain. Nobody chooses insanity. They happen
because there is not enough presence in you to dissolve the past, not enough light to
dispel the darkness. You are not fully here. You have not quite woken up yet. In the
meantime, the conditioned mind is running your life.
Similarly, if you are one of the many people who have an issue with their parents, if
you still harbor resentment about something they did or did not do, then you still
believe that they had a choice - that they could have acted differently. It always looks
as if people had a choice, but that is an illusion. As long as your mind with its condi-
tioned patterns runs your life, as long as you are your mind, what choice do you
have? None. You are not even there. The mind-identified state is severely
dysfunctional. It is a form of insanity. Almost everyone is suffering from this illness
in varying degrees. The moment you realize this, there can be no more resentment.
How can you resent someone's illness? The only appropriate response is compassion.


So that means nobody is responsible for what they do? I don't like that idea.
If you are run by your mind, although you have no choice you will still suffer the
consequences of your unconsciousness, and you will create further suffering. You
will bear the burden of fear, conflict, problems, and pain. The suffering thus created
will eventually force you out of your unconscious state.


What you say about choice also applies to forgiveness, I suppose. You need to be fully
conscious and surrender before you can forgive.
"Forgiveness" is a term that has been in use for 2,000 years, but most people have a
very limited view of what it means. You cannot truly forgive yourself or others as
long as you derive your sense of self from the past. Only through accessing the
power of the Now, which is your own power, can there be true forgiveness. This
renders the past powerless, and you realize deeply that nothing you ever did or that




                                            143

was ever done to you could touch even in the slightest the radiant essence of who
you are. The whole concept of forgiveness then becomes unnecessary.


And how do I get to that point of realization?
When you surrender to what is and so become fully present, the past ceases to have
any power. You do not need it anymore. Presence is the key. The Now is the key.


How will I know when I have surrendered?
When you no longer need to ask the question.
